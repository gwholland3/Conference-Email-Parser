Dear conference attendees, authors and colleagues:

This is one more Call For Help.
This email is being sent to all registered authors, speakers, and
participants of the following conferences:


gem-icai-ike-help

--> The 2012 International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary
    Methods (GEM'12: July 16-19, 2012, Las Vegas, USA)

--> The 2012 International Conference on Information and Knowledge
    Engineering (IKE'12: July 16-19, 2012, Las Vegas, USA)

--> The 2012 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence
    (ICAI'12: July 16-19, 2012, Las Vegas, USA)

http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp12/ws 

We have over 200 sessions for the congress; a few of these sessions
do not yet have chairs/moderators. The list of sessions that we need
help with is appended to this email; for each session (below), you will
find: the title of the session, the date and time, and conference room
number.

REQUEST FOR HELP:

If you know that you will be attending the conference and would be willing
to help us by chairing/co-chairing one or more sessions (list of sessions
is appended to this email) then please email me the following information
as soon as possible (your help would be a great service to the conference
and we would be most grateful to you for helping out):

-> I am 100% confident that I will be attending the conference AND I am
-> willing to chair/moderate one or more of the sessions below:
-> 
->     Session ID Number(s) and Title(s):
->     Date of the session(s):
->     Your Title (Prof./Dr./...):
->     Your name:
->     Your affiliation and country:

EXPECTATION FROM THE CHAIRS: session chairs are expected to:

-> Attach a red ribbon to their name tags (available from the conference staff).
-> Sit in the front row of the conference room (where the session will be
   held). Session chairs are expected to be in the conference room at least
   15 minutes before the session is scheduled to start.
-> Make sure that each talk starts at the scheduled time and respectfully ask
   the speaker to finish his presentation if he/she is begining to go over time.
-> Encourage relevant questions (time permitting).
-> After the conference, report to the Steering Committee ( sc@world-comp.org )
   if any of the speakers did not show up.

There is no doubt that we will have a great gathering (thanks to you, all
authors who submitted papers, PC members, and all our sponsors.)

I very much look forward to seeing you in July.

Kindest regards,
SC (on behalf of Prof. Hamid R. Arabnia)

ps. We have reserved a large block of rooms at Monte Carlo Resort (this is where
    the conference will be held) at a low negotiated rate. The hotel has agreed
    to extend the reservation deadline at the low rate till June 28, 2012. If
    you have not yet reserved your room and would like to stay at the hotel
    where the conference will be held, then you need to do your room reservation
    very soon - our block of 3,800 room nights are getting close to being fully
    booked (reservations will be honored by the hotel on First-Come First-Serve
    basis till the block is fully booked). In order to reserve a room at the
    hotel, see the web link below:
