TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO) THE FOLLOWINGS:

Computational Biology is the science of using biological data to develop
algorithms and relations among various biological systems. It involves the
application of data-analytical and algorithms, mathematical modeling and
simulation techniques to the study of biological systems. The field is
multidisciplinary in that it includes topics that are traditionally
covered in computer science, mathematics, imaging science, statistics,
chemistry, biophysics, genetics, genomics, ecology, evolution, anatomy,
neuroscience, and visualization where computer science acts as the topical
bridge between all such diverse areas (for a formal definition of
Computational Biology, refer to the Computational_biology wiki page).
Many consider the area of Bioinformatics to be a sub-field of Computational
Biology which includes methods for storing, retrieving, organizing and
analyzing biological data. The area of Systems Biology is an emerging
methodology applied to biomedical and biological scientific research.
It is an area that overlaps with computational biology and bioinformatics.
In addition, the area of Big Data and Data Analytics has become an
important topic in Computational Biology. This edited book will cover the
emerging trends in all aspects of Computational Biology, Bioinformatics,
and Systems Biology. The topics of interest appear below (but we are not
limited to only these topics - therefore, the list below should be
considered to be only a partial list):

   O  COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY:
      Computational biology involves the development and application of
      data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and
      computational simulation techniques to the study of biological and
      behavioral systems. Topics of interest include (but not limited to):

   O  BIOINFORMATICS - DATABASES, DATA MINING, AND PATTERN DISCOVERY:
      Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary scientific field that is
      concerned with methods for storing, retrieving, organizing and
      analyzing biological data. The field is also concerned with software
      tools to generate useful biological knowledge. Many of the methods
      in bioinformatics have foundations in mathematics and statistics.

      becomes difficult to process using conventional database management
      systems or traditional data processing applications. With the advent of
      high-throughput genomics, life scientists are starting to demand
      massive data sets, encountering challenges with handling, processing
      and moving information that were once the domain of other disciplines.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by
   uploading them to:
   http://world-comp.org/elsevier-morgan-kaufman-CBB/ 

   Submissions must be received by no later than November 1, 2014 and
   must be in either, MS doc or pdf format. Although we do not have a
   specific page limit, we anticipate that a typical paper would be
   about 10 pages long. At this point, all reasonable typesetting
   formats are acceptable; however, authors of accepted papers will
   later be asked to follow a particular typesetting format/instructions
   to prepare their papers for publication/press. 864453

   Papers must not have been previously published or currently submitted
   for publication elsewhere. However, we will consider and encourage
   submissions that are the EXTENDED versions of already published
   conference papers. The first page of the paper should include: title
   of the paper, authors' names, their affiliations, city and country.
   The first page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and
   a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content
   of the paper. For each author, his/her email address should also
   be provided.

   Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, impact,
   and soundness. Each paper will be refereed by at least two experts in
   the field. The referees' evaluations will then be reviewed by the editors
   who will recommend a decision.

   This invitation is being sent to selected authors of CSCI and BIOCOMP
   annual conferences
   http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?reload=true&punumber=6820887 
   as well as to authors of other relevant conferences giving such authors
   the opportunity to submit the extended versions of their papers for
   publication consideration in this book series. This invitation is also
   being sent to various listservs whose subscribers may include authors
   who wish to submit papers to this book.
   

HISTORY:

   In recent years, the same co-editors composed the following books in the
   subject matter:
   http://www.springer.com/life+sciences/biochemistry+%26+biophysics/book/978-1-4419-5912-6 
   http://www.springer.com/life+sciences/systems+biology+and+bioinformatics/book/978-1-4419-7045-9 

   The above books are now among the top 20% most downloaded books based on
   the publisher's record. We are hoping that this new book will be at least
   as successful as the above books.
