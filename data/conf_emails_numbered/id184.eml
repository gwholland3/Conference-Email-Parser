+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> (Since the original deadline for submission of papers coincided with the
-> Spring break of many US and Far East institutions, the Steering Committee
-> decided to extend the deadlines in response to numerous requests. Those
-> authors who met the original deadlines, will receive the decision on
-> their papers based on the original dates; i.e., notifications will not
-> be delayed for those authors.)

You are invited to submit a full paper for consideration. All accepted
papers will be published in printed conference books/proceedings (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. In addition, like prior years, extended
versions of selected papers (about 35%) will appear in journals and edited
research books (publishers include: Springer, Elsevier, BMC, and others).
See the following links for a small subset of the publications based on
accepted papers in the federated congress that SAM is part of; some of
these books and journal special issues have already received the top 25%
downloads in their respective fields. To get a feeling about the
conferences' atmosphere, see some delegates photos available at:

SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them
to the evaluation web site at:  

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sam14

Submissions must be uploaded by April 19, 2014 and must be in pdf formats
(about 7 pages including all figures, tables, and references - single
space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable typesetting formats are
acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow
a particular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for
publication.) Papers must not have been previously published or currently
submitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should
include: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email
address for each author. The first page should also identify the name of
the Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best
represent the content of the paper. The track title must also be stated
on the first page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word abstract. The
length of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to
7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of
contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program
committee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);
often, this would involve seeking help from additional referees.
Papers whose authors include a member of the conference program
committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded review process.
(Essay/philosophical papers will not be refereed but may be considered
for discussion/panels).

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in
science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each
published paper. Science citation databases include: Elsevier indexing
products (SCI Elsevier products include, among others: Scopus,
www.info.scopus.com; Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE,
www.info.embase.com; and others); Inspec / IET / The Institute for
Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for Scientific
Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessible from INIST, Datastar,
Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN International); and
others.

SUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:

Poster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same
instructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except
for the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author
should state that "This paper is being submitted as a poster". Poster papers
(if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the accepted paper
wishes to do so. Please email your poster papers to the poster co-chairs:

GENERAL INFORMATION:

SAM is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,
professionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster
working relationships and gain access to the latest research results.
It is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of
other research conferences; namely, The 2014 World Congress in Computer
Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing. The Congress is
one of the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer science,
computer engineering and applied computing. We anticipate to have 2,100
or more attendees from over 85 countries. The 2014 Congress will be
composed of research presentations, keynote lectures, invited presentations,
tutorials, panel discussions, and poster presentations. In recent past,
keynote/tutorial/panel speakers have included: Prof. David A. Patterson
(pioneer, architecture, U. of California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler
(known as Father of Nanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known as
Father of Genetic Algorithms; U. of Michigan), Prof. Ian Foster (known as
Father of Grid Computing; U. of Chicago & ANL), Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy
(pioneer, VR, U. of California, Berkeley), Prof. Barry Vercoe (Founding
member of MIT Media Lab, MIT), Dr. Jim Gettys (known as X-man, developer
of X Window System, xhost; OLPC), Prof. John Koza (known as Father of
Genetic Programming, Stanford U.), Prof. Brian D. Athey (NIH Program
Director, U. of Michigan), Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna (pioneer, U. of
Southern California), Dr. Jose L. Munoz (NSF Program Director and
Consultant), Prof. Jun Liu (pioneer, Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard U.),
Prof. Lotfi A. Zadeh (Father of Fuzzy Logic), Dr. Firouz Naderi (Head,
NASA Mars Exploration Program/2000-2005 and Associate Director, Project
Formulation & Strategy, Jet Propulsion Lab, CalTech/NASA; Director, NASA's
JPL Solar System Exploration), Prof. David Lorge Parnas (Fellow of IEEE,
ACM, RSC, CAE, GI; Dr.h.c.: ETH Zurich, Prof. Emeritus, McMaster U. and
U. of Limerick), Prof. Eugene H. Spafford (Executive Director, CERIAS and
Professor, Purdue University), Dr. Sandeep Chatterjee (Vice President &
Chief Technology Officer, SourceTrace Systems, Inc.), Prof. Haym Hirsh
(Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA and former director of Division of
Information and Intelligent Systems, National Science Foundation, USA;
currently, Dean at Cornell University), Dr. Flavio Villanustre (Vice-

An important mission of the Congress is "Providing a unique platform for a
diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities (such
as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies, and
research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also attempts
to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as their main
mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that have research
as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to achieve its
institution and geography diversity objectives." 138939
One main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of
computer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The
Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary
research initiatives; i.e., facilitating increased opportunities for
cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines. Below, you will find a
small subset of the books and journal special issues published based
on extended versions of accepted papers in the congress that SAM
is part of:

MEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:

As of December 14, 2013, papers published in the conference proceedings
that have been held as part of the federated congress, have received over
27,500 citations (includes about 3,300 self-citations). Citation data
