SUBMISSION OF LATE BREAKING PAPERS, POSITION PAPERS, ABSTRACTS/POSTERS:

In response to this announcement, authors are given the opportunity to submit
their papers for evaluation in one of the following three categories:

   1. Late Breaking Papers: describe late-breaking/recent developments in
      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the following
      on the first page of your submission "GCA: LATE BREAKING PAPER".
      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited
      to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the
      opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.

   2. Position Papers: enable discussions on emerging topics without the
      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,
      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward
      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.
      The maximum number of pages is 4. Please write the following on the
      first page of your submission "GCA: POSITION PAPER".
      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited
      to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the
      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.

   3. Abstract/Poster Papers: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD
      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please
      write the following on the first page of your submission
      "GCA: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER".
      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited
      to 2 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the
      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers (see above for
paper categories) by uploading them to the evaluation web site at:
http://world-comp.org .
Submissions must be uploaded by June 2, 2013 and must be in either MS doc or
pdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the
authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting
format to prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have
been previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.
The first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,
affiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The first
page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5
topical keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of
contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program
committee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);
often, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers
whose authors include a member of the conference program committee will
be evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Papers deemed
to be philosophical, essay type, or about controversial topics/applications
will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels/presentation).

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in
science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each
published paper. Science citation databases include: relevant Elsevier
indexing products (SCI Elsevier products include, among others: Scopus,
www.info.scopus.com; Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE,
www.info.embase.com; and others); Inspec / IET / The Institute for
Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for Scientific Research,
CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog,
EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN International); and others.

Note that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement, will
have their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the Final
Edition of the conference proceedings which will go to press soon after the
conference (the conference would then make the necessary arrangements to ship
the printed proceedings/books to such authors). The Final Edition of the
conference proceedings will be identical to earlier edition except for a
number of sections/chapters appended to the proceedings/book.

In addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with
Elsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)
and another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science
and Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number
of authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the opportunity
to submit the extended version of their papers for publication consideration
in these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books a year in each
of these book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to
Elsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes: Scopus,
Ei village, SCI, ...).


GENERAL INFORMATION:

GCA is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,
professionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster
working relationships and gain access to the latest research results.
It is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of
other research conferences; namely, The 2013 World Congress in Computer
Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing. The Congress is
the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer science,
computer engineering and applied computing. We anticipate to have 2,100
or more attendees from over 85 countries.

The 2013 Congress will be composed of research presentations, keynote
lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and
poster presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel speakers
have included: Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer, architecture, U. of
California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler (known as Father of
Nanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known as Father of Genetic

An important mission of the Congress is "Providing a unique platform for
a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities
(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also
attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that
have research as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to
achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

One main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of
computer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The
Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary
research initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for
cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.
