Hi Foaad,

I've had a look at the conference Web site, in particular at the history an=
d the program committee members. It's been around for a while, and I've rec=
ognized a few names on the committee member list, which are good signs. I'v=
e also had a look at the search results, and have recognized some of the au=
thor names. So overall, I think your assessment is right - it's not a top c=
onference, but seems to be legitimate.=20
