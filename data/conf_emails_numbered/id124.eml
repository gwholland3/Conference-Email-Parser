FOREWORD:

   We anticipate having between 1,000 and 2,000 participants in the
   Congress that ICAI'19 is part of. The congress includes 20 tracks
   ( https://www.americancse.org/events/csce2019 ) composed of: 122
   technical, research, and panel sessions as well as a number of
   keynote lectures and tutorials; all will be held simultaneously,
   same location and dates: July 29 - August 1, 2019. Last year,
   the Congress had attracted speakers/authors and participants
   affiliated with over 169 different universities (including many
   from the top 50 ranked institutions), major IT corporations
   (including: Microsoft, Google, Apple, SAP, Facebook, Oracle, Amazon,
   Yahoo, Samsung, IBM, Ebay, GE, Siemens, Philips, Ericsson, BAE
   Systems, Hitachi, NTT, ...), major corporations (including: Exxon
   Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, PetroChina, GlaxoSmithKline,
   HSBC, Airbus, Boeing, Hyundai, ...), government research agencies

   national laboratories (including, NASA, ANL, LLNL, Sandia, ORNL,
   Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, National
   Cancer Institute, NIST, ...), and a number of Venture Capitalists as
   well as distinguished speakers discussing Intellectual Property
   issues. Last year, 55% of attendees were from academia, 24% from
   industry; 20% from government and funding agencies; and 1% unknown.
   About half of the attendees were from outside USA; from 72 nations.
   The event is among the top five largest international annual gathering
   of researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
   computing. To get a feeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see

   papers for publication which conform to the two-column IEEE style
   format - see:
   https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
   The first page of the paper should include:

   - Title of the paper

     permitting).
   Submissions are to be uploaded to the submission/evaluation web site
   portal at http://american-cse.org/ 

   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by at least two experts in the field
   for originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness.
