   papers for publication which conform to the two-column IEEE style
   format - see:
   https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
   The first page of the paper should include:

   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by at least two experts in the field
   for originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness.
