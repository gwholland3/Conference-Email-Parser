SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them
to the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must
be uploaded by March 18, 2013 and must be in either MS doc or pdf
formats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables, and references -
single space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable typesetting formats
are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to
follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for
publication.) Papers must not have been previously published or currently
submitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should
include: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email
address for each author. The first page should also identify the name of
the Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best
represent the content of the paper. The name of the conference that the
paper is being submitted for consideration must also be stated on the
first page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word abstract. The length
of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to 7
(two-column IEEE style) pages.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of
contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program
committee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);
often, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers
whose authors include a member of the conference program committee will
be evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical
papers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in
science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each
published paper. Science citation databases include: Inspec / IET / The
Institute for Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for
Scientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST,
Datastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, & STN International);
and others. Though, there is no guarantee that the proceedings will also
be included in SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings; in the past, the
proceedings were included in these databases. Therefore, we will also be
sending the proceedings for indexing procedures to SCI EI Compendex/
Elsevier. The printed proceedings/books will be available for
distribution on site at the conference.


SUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:

Poster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same
instructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except
for the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author
should state that "This paper is being submitted as a poster". Poster
papers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the
accepted paper wishes to do so.

An important mission of The Congress is "Providing a unique platform for
a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities
(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also
attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that
have research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to
achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of
computer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The
Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary
research initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for
cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.

MEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:

As of December 2012, papers published in the conference proceedings that
are currently being held as part of WORLDCOMP, have received over 27,000
citations (includes about 2,000 self-citations). Citation data obtained
from http://academic.research.microsoft.com/ .
