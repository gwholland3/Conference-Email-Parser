Dear Michael,

I'm just trying to think of solutions that would make participants feel
safe to submit. People on location know best if they could be held
accountable for the presentations made by participants outside the country.
It might seem a bit paranoid to think the government would go to the extent
of intercepting and listening if it is not presented as LGBT related, but
in such a context it would not be surprising that authorities pay close
attention to any event in academia and be very proactive about holding
people accountable. I trust orgnizers know best about this.

Again, no easy solutions. It is hard to balance the benefits for the local
communities of having these conferences be hosted in parts of the world
with violent regimes and the need to be as inclusive as possible for every
instalment of the conference.

Best,

            no problem for the

                <p>Dear Dr Parker,</p>
                <p>Thanks for asking a question that may have been on
                  many people=E2=80=99s minds. I have been discussing this =
issue
                  with Alina Latypova, the conference chair. My
                  understanding is that St Petersburg is an
                  international city, and that it is extremely unlikely
                  that there will be any LGBT directed harassment. There
                  also appear to be high levels of support for equal
                  rights for the LGBT community in response to the
                  government=E2=80=99s lamentable position. Of course nobod=
y can
                  give definitive assurances about any city, but I hope
                  that we can offer some reassurances. We have an
                  inclusivity policy that is stated on the website.
                  Anyone is welcome to write to us to continue this
