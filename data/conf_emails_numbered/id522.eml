Dear all,

The decision to hold the PoCG conference in St Petersburg this year was
made by the PoCG steering committee. The intention was to reach out to the
group of game scholars working at St Petersburg State University who have
made a notable contribution to the community, particularly at the PoCG 2018
conference, and to accept their bid as hosts. I was not involved in this
decision but I have confidence that the committee thought about the issues
currently being discussed. I believe that where the conference series has
previously been held was taken into account; St Petersburg will mark the
farthest afield from Western Europe that the series has gone, with perhaps
the exception of Istanbul in 2014. That is to say, there was the intention
to be less Western-centric and to be inclusive of scholars who might
otherwise not have been able to participate, building bridges between
academic communities. As has already been mentioned, some of those who
might be excluded by the decision to only hold academic conferences in
democratic countries include LGBT+ scholars from non-democratic countries.

There obviously has to be a balancing exercise as to who is included and
who else are then excluded by this very act of inclusion. Further, who is
making the decision and how they are doing so must also be scrutinised. I
believe that we are interrogating this now on Gamesnetwork. As a result, it
is appropriate for the steering committee to review the situation and to
consider what can be done to foster inclusivity. They will report back
soon. I will also consult again with the organising committee.

This conference will not be deemed by the Russian government to be
LGBT-themed. We very much welcome any LGBT+ content that is germane to the
conference theme of =E2=80=98the aesthetics of computer games=E2=80=99 and =
I do not believe
that the inclusion of such content will lead to attention from government
forces, particularly because there will not be anyone present under the age
of 18 and also because it is a small-scale English-speaking conference. We
are now, however, considering having all the workshops and panels be on the
theme of =E2=80=98diversity in games=E2=80=99, with the papers still being =
on =E2=80=98the
aesthetics of computer games=E2=80=99. More details on this will follow.

It goes without saying that no city is safe. London, where I live, is
deemed a 'safe' city, but has recently seen homophobic hate crimes rise.
https://www.met.police.uk/sd/stats-and-data/met/hate-crime-dashboard/

A particularly nasty attack on a bus against two women was just reported
last week. Of course London does not lie in an authoritarian state.
Traveling to another city in another country involves a calculated risk for
those of us who are LGBT+. It is a highly personal decision to be made
after some thought and on the basis of the available information. Here, it
may be appropriate to distinguish between safety in Russia taken as a whole
(listed as a lowly 157 in the 2018 Spartacus Guide), and safety in St
Petersburg, perhaps its most LGBT-friendly city. On the one hand, it may
have been paternalistic for us to point to particular scattered sources
that one should consult when making this personal decision, but on the
other, we could perhaps have done more to provide guidance. How to provide
this guidance - over and above having encouraged individuals to contact us
- will be considered by the steering committee.

The technical feasibility of teleconferencing has not been settled and is
still on the discussion agenda. Obviously, it is no substitute to actually
attending a conference and as such remains exclusionary, but it could be a
useful tool in a difficult situation that does not admit of easy solutions.

Finally, to address a particular point that have been raised:

I'm afraid I do not know about the specifics of laws aimed at known
activists. I will find out and let you know, Phoenix. This information will
then be on the website.

If my previous email was rushed and did not attend to the complexities of
the matter, I apologise. It has still not been possible to contact all the
members of the steering committee and I represent here, as program chair,
only my own thoughts. Again, anyone who wants to get in touch with us
outside of the listserv is most welcome to do so.

The steering committee will report back soon.

Best regards,

Feng

<br><br></p><p>First, I must agree with most points made throughout this th=
read. Just to recap:</p><p>While promoting venues for international academi=
c events, we must be upfront about any possible challenges and troubles pos=
ed by the local antidemocratic regimes or hate-groups or any other dark for=
ces. We, indeed, shouldn=E2=80=99t give anybody false sense of security. Ru=
ssia is, indeed, NOT safe for LGBT&#43; people. Therefore, visiting Russia =
requires a careful consideration.<br><br></p><p>Such consideration, however=
, must be based on a systemic approach and has to take into account as much=
 data as possible so an informed decision can be made. Statistics regarding=
 street attacks and censorship in media surely tell us how homophobic Russi=
an society and Russian government are, but they are of little help if our q=
uestion is how likely it is that an LGBT&#43; participant of an academic co=
nference gets into trouble. In that case we must consider the data regardin=
g the number of academic conferences attacked by the government or whoever =
else on the basis of anti-LGBT ideology. Now there is a very straightforwar=
d bifurcation: an event (academic or not) is either explicitly LGBT-themed =
or it is not. If it is, then problems might arise, because our governmental=
 or pro-governmental forces sometimes attack such events. But if it is not,=
 then it goes completely under the radar. Russian authorities don=E2=80=99t=
 care about academic life. Needless to say, they don=E2=80=99t have anybody=
 in charge of inspecting each and every academic conference for ideological=
 impurity. And it is exactly our case: this particular double-conference is=
n=E2=80=99t LGBT-themed. Moreover, its topic is nominally way outside of wh=
at our authorities consider to be politics. For our authorities, it is just=
 another academic event in a long chain of academic events which happen in =
our country all the time. There is no reason for them to pay any attention =
to this particular conference. We must take into account that Russia hosts =
many academic conferences in almost all academic fields each year (and we a=
lready hosted 2 international game studies conferences in particular). Now =
we must ask whether any non-LGBT-themed academic conference was ever attack=
ed in Russia on the basis of having LGBT people or LGBT-themed presentation=
s in them. Neither my colleagues, nor I can remember any such case, quick s=
earch also yields no results. To conclude: although nobody in a right mind =
will tell you that an LGBT person has nothing to be afraid of in Russia, th=
ere is also no reason to think that any reactionary forces will decide to t=
arget this particular academic conference on any basis, especially given th=
at this conference is in English.<br><br></p><p>Next, I=E2=80=99d like to a=
ddress a broader matter regarding organizing conferences in anti-democratic=
 countries in general. I believe there are LGBT&#43; scholars in all academ=
ic fields and I know that many academic fields within social sciences and h=
umanities have LGBT-related topics. If the democratic countries decide to w=
ithdraw all international conferences from anti-democratic countries for se=
curity reasons (until everyone becomes democratic), then I=E2=80=99m afraid=
 this enterprise is doomed. Again, if asked about whether or not we should =
have a Queer Game Studies conference in modern-day Russia I would do my bes=
t to discourage everyone from doing so. But if we stop having game studies =
conferences or any kind of academic conferences in general in Russia and si=
milarly repressive countries we will just further ghettoize their academic =
communities.</p><p><br></p><p>Just in case, I=E2=80=99m not here to tell an=
ybody &quot;how to academy&quot;; my point is, the longer this thread goes =
the more it sounds as if there were no academic conferences in Russia in an=
y field EVER and now we are about to have the very first one in history and=
 we have no idea how it may turn out. <span style=3D"text-decoration:underl=
ine">It is clearly not the case.</span> We started from whether or not it i=
s safe for LGBT&#43; people to attend this very particular game studies con=
ference, but after several posts I can see carpet-bombing statements regard=
ing whether or not we should organize academic events AS SUCH in countries =
like Russia =E2=80=93 or at least it sounds that way because it is not spec=
ified anymore whether it is about LGBT-themed conference or a conference in=
 general, whether it is a game studies conference or a conference in genera=
l. And I=E2=80=99d also like to make a remark about making a statement by e=
xcluding oppressive countries from potential conference hosts: the only peo=
ple how will hear such a statement are scholars who already support LGBT, b=
ecause oppressors themselves neither listen nor care.<br><br>This is a rush=
ed response so it might appear unbalanced, I apologize for that and hope th=
at it doesn't seem disrespectful towards anyone's position.</p></div><div><=
