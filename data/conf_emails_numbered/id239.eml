IMPORTANT DATES:

January 30, 2015:  Workshop / Session Proposals
March 31, 2015:    Submission of full papers (about 7 pages)
April 24, 2015:    Notification of acceptance (+/- two days)
May 15, 2015:      Final papers + Copyright + Registration
July 27-30, 2015:  International Conference on Biomedical Engineering
                   and Science (BIOENG'15)


SUBMISSION OF DRAFT PAPERS FOR EVALUATION:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them
to the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must
be uploaded by the due date (see IMPORTANT DATES) and must be in either
MS doc or pdf formats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables, and
references.) All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later,
the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular
typesetting format to prepare their final papers for publication; these
formatting instructions appear at: http://world-comp.org and they
conform to the two-column IEEE style format). Papers must not have been
previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.
The first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,
affiliation, postal address, and email address for each author as well
as a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content
of the paper. The first page should also identify the name of the
Contact/Corresponding author together with his/her professional email
address. A 100 to 150-word abstract should appear on the first page.
Authors are to conform to the common CODE OF ETHICS FOR AUTHORS (The
document for the Code of Ethics is available on the submission web site.)

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of
contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program
committee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);
often, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers
whose authors include a member of the conference program committee will
be evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical
papers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. The printed proceedings/books will
be available for distribution on site at the conference. The proceedings
will be indexed in science citation databases that track citation
frequency/data. The proceedings/books of the federated congress that
this conference is part of have been evaluated for inclusion into major
science citation index databases. We are happy to report that so far,
the evaluation board of science citation index databases have approved
the indexing, integrating, and inclusion of the following conference
tracks into relevant indexing databases (indexing databases include,
among others: Scopus, Engineering Village, EMBASE, and others):
BIOCOMP, DMIN, GCA, ICAI, ICOMP, ICWN, IKE, IPCV, PDPTA, and SAM. All
proceedings are also approved for inclusion into EBSCO (www.ebsco.com),
one of the largest subject index systems. The titles of proceedings of the
federated congress have been indexed into the ACM Digital Library
( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes bibliographic citations from major
publishers in computing.

In addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple
books in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in
Computer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer
publishers (Transactions of Computational Science and Computational
Intelligence). After the conference (the process may take 12 to 18
months), a significant number of authors of accepted papers of our
congress, will be given the opportunity to submit the extended version
of their papers for publication consideration in these books. We
anticipate having between 10 and 20 books a year in each of these
book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to
Elsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes:
Scopus, www.info.scopus.com; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village,
www.ei.org; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com; and others). For a recent and
a very small subset of the books (and journal special issues) that have
been published based on the extended versions of our congress papers,
see below:

   and Systems Biology Publisher.

Some of these books and journal special issues have already received
the top 25% downloads in their respective fields - we already have a
number of Elsevier and Springer books in the pipeline.


SUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:

Poster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same
instructions that appear in section SUBMISSION OF DRAFT PAPERS FOR
EVALUATION - except that the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the
first page, the author should state that "This paper is being submitted
as a poster". Poster papers (if accepted) will be published as such, if
and only if the author of the accepted poster wishes to do so.


PROPOSAL FOR ORGANIZING WORKSHOPS/SESSIONS:

The conference is composed of a number of tracks. A track is a session,
a workshop, or a symposium. A session will have at least 6 papers; a
workshop at least 12 papers; and a symposium at least 18 papers. Track
chairs will be responsible for all aspects of their tracks, including:
soliciting papers, reviewing, selecting, ... The names of track chairs
will appear as Associate Editors in the conference proceedings and on
the cover of the printed books (and would be indexed in science databases
as such). Track chairs who attract a sufficient number of solid papers
can propose to edit books with a major publisher based on the extended
versions of the papers accepted in their tracks (the conference will
facilitate and help such track chairs to get the publisher's approval).

Proposals to organize tracks (sessions, workshops, or symposiums) should
include the following information: name and address (+ email) of proposer,
his/her biography, title of track, a 100-word description of the topic of
the track (also mention the name of this conference), and a short
description on how the track will be advertised (in most cases, track
proposers solicit papers from colleagues and researchers whose work is
known to the track proposer). E-mail your track proposal to
editor@world-comp.org . We would like to receive the track proposals
as soon as possible (see IMPORTANT DATES.)

atmosphere, see some delegates photos available at:

http://worldcomp.phanfare.com/

"Start SlideShow" tab at the url above.)

An important mission of The Congress is "Providing a unique platform for
a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities
(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also
attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that
have research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to
achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer
science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also
encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;
i.e., facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across
sub-disciplines. 138939
