Hello All,
I=E2=80=99ve followed this thread pretty closely as a trans game studies =
scholar, and what I=E2=80=99ve read here isn=E2=80=99t really =
reassuring. Given how LGBTQ folks often face harassment even in =
supposedly safe and accepting places, reassurances that it will =
*probably* be fine, and the government will *probably* look the other =
way for foreigners presenting on queer experiences and studies, and =
queer participants will be *relatively* safe ring pretty hollow. I was =
particularly alarmed when I read that LGB is probably fine, but the Ts =
might have to worry. I don=E2=80=99t doubt that that is likely an =
accurate reflection of the situation given how trans, genderqueer, and =
nonbinary folks are most frequently targeted for harassment, assault, =
and legislation. However a situation where only some members of the =
LGBTQ community are welcome or safe isn=E2=80=99t inclusive or helpful.

The teleconferencing option, while better than nothing, feels like a =
bandage on the larger issue=E2=80=94presenting from a distance often =
involves just giving the presentation and being involved with one panel =
and then leaving, which means missing out on a lot of the discussion and =
networking that makes conferencing valuable in the first place. It might =
be the best option available for providing safe presentation options to =
queer and particularly trans game studies scholars if the conference is =
to continue in St. Petersburg, but it=E2=80=99s not an ideal or =
particularly inclusive solution. I don=E2=80=99t have an easy answer to =
this because there isn=E2=80=99t one, but it seems to me that the =
conference has to decide between safety and support for LGBTQ game =
scholars and the importance of holding the conference in different =
locations that allow more people to participate. Whatever is decided =
here and moving forward, I think it=E2=80=99s important that the safety =
of queer folks not be sacrificed in the name of holding a conference in =
more locations, and ideally finding conference locations that accomplish =
both. I do hope that the St. Petersburg conference will provide =
opportunities to present for folks who aren=E2=80=99t able to make other =
international conferences and particularly local LGBTQ folks, though it =
seems that they too might have to be careful about what they present at =
the conference.

I would also humbly submit that if you=E2=80=99re working on a trans or =
queer game as a cisgendered and/or straight scholar and think that the =
queerness of that game is coincidental or not the main point, that you =
may need to think carefully about your positionality in relationship to =
that game, how you are using it, and to what ends. The minimization of =
queerness in games is a longstanding heteronormative project, and it =
would be disappointing to see game studies scholarship continue to =
contribute to it.

reassurances that it will *probably* be fine, and the government will *prob=
