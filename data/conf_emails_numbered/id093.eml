     CSCI-ISSC RESEARCH TRACKS: (SMART CITIES & SMART MOBILITY)

     Prologue: A smart city utilizes different types and different
     kinds of electronic data collection sensors to supply information
     which is used to manage assets and optimize the use of resources
     for the good of citizens. Typically, data is collected from
     devices and assets that is analyzed to monitor and manage
     transportation systems, power grids, water supply networks, waste
     management, law enforcement, information systems, schools,
     libraries, hospitals, and other services. An important component
     of a smart city infrastructure is smart mobility. Smart Mobility
     focuses mainly on challenges that relate to transportation. Some
     consider a successful Smart Mobility framework to offer modes of
     transportation alongside or even instead of personal gas-powered
     vehicles. Considering the above broad description, the topical
     scope of CSCI-ISSC is given below. The list of topics is by no
     means meant to be exhaustive.

        Smart Cities:
        - Algorithms
        - City Infrastructures
        - Communication Frameworks
        - Big Data Analytics
        - Health care
        - Security
        - Internet of Things
        - Smart Grid
        - Inclusive and Sharing Cities
        - Sustainable Buildings
        - Efficient Energy utilization
        - Video Monitoring Systems
        - Automation, Robotics, and Control
        - Applications

        Smart Mobility:
        - Methodologies that help keep cities moving
        - Traffic Management and Engineering
        - Smart Public Transportation
        - Self-Driving Vehicles
        - Communication Logistics
        - Parking Management Systems
        - Cyber-Physical systems and Devices
        - Economy of Smart Mobility
        - Governance of Smart Mobility
        - Cloud Computing Utilization
        - Coordination Strategies


PUBLISHER:
     IEEE CPS: https://www.computer.org/conferences/cps 
     All accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the
     2019 International Conference on Computational Science &
     Computational Intelligence. Since its inception, all CSCI
     proceedings have always been approved and included into IEEE
     Xplore indexation, digital-library citation index databases.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF PAPERS FOR EVALUATION:

   https://americancse.org/events/csci2019/paper_submission 

TYPE OF SUBMISSIONS/PAPERS:

  - Full/Regular Research Papers (maximum of 6 pages):
    Regular Research Papers should provide detail original research
    contributions. They must report new research results that
    represent a contribution to the field; sufficient details and
    support for the results and conclusions should also be provided.
    The work presented in regular papers are expected to be at a
    stage of maturity that with some additional work can be published
    as journal papers.

  - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):
    Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should
    provide overall research methodologies with some results. The
    work presented in short papers are expected to be at a stage of
    maturity that with some additional work can be published as
    regular papers.

  - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):
    Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are still
    in their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such papers tend
    to provide research methodologies without yet concrete results.
