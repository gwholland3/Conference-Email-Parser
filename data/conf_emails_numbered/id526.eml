Hi folks,=20

Does anyone know the actual law for those of us who are activists online? I=

Dear Dr Parker,
Thanks for asking a question that may have been on many people=E2=80=99s mi=
nds. I have been discussing this issue with Alina Latypova, the conference =
chair. My understanding is that St Petersburg is an international city, and=
 that it is extremely unlikely that there will be any LGBT directed harassm=
ent. There also appear to be high levels of support for equal rights for th=
e LGBT community in response to the government=E2=80=99s lamentable positio=
n. Of course nobody can give definitive assurances about any city, but I ho=
pe that we can offer some reassurances. We have an inclusivity policy that =
is stated on the website. Anyone is welcome to write to us to continue this=
 discussion: feng.zhu@kcl.ac.uk
Kind regards,

 mode of experience that is specific to computer games? How do their visual=
, audio, and haptic aspects come together to produce distinctive experience=
s? How are =E2=80=98experience=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98perception=E2=80=99 ex=
plored in computer games and shaped by them? Can concepts such as =E2=80=98=
affect=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98atmosphere=E2=80=99, and =E2=80=98rhythm=E2=80=99=
 be productively applied to computer games? What is the role of game interf=
aces on player experience?=20

2. Games as art? What are the conditions of possibility of games being art?=
 How do computer games fit into established categories or conventions of ae=
sthetics, and how do they contribute to new ones? Do games recognised as ha=
ving a claim to artistic status differ from mainstream games? How do accoun=
ts of art based on necessary and sufficient conditions match up against ant=
i-essentialist accounts in terms of gauging the status of computer games?=20

3. The aesthetics of gaming practices. Are games collaboratively authored? =
How do different kinds of play, or player-game conjunctions, bring about di=
fferent kinds of gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences? How do differen=
t bodies encounter computer games and what can be said about the way in whi=
ch gameplay experience is mediated by our bodies?=20
Do some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic player practices have an aesthetic=
 orientation? Are computer games performances?=20

4. The ethical, political, and social dimensions of game aesthetics. What i=
s the transformative potential of computer games and how does this compare =
to the transformative capabilities ascribed to artworks? How do aesthetic i=
ssues interconnect with ethical, social, and political ones =E2=80=93 what =
is the autonomy or heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are taste, sensi=
bility, and habit acquired with respect to gameplay and what are the social=
 implications of this?=20

In addition to this central theme, the conference also features an open cat=
egory, for which we invite welcome contributions that do not fit this year=
=E2=80=99s theme, but that nonetheless offer a valuable contribution to the=
 philosophy of computer games.=20

Submitted proposals should have a clear focus on philosophy and philosophic=
al (including media philosophical) issues in relation to computer games. Th=
ey should also refer to specific games rather than invoke them in more gene=
ral terms. Submissions should be made in the form of extended abstracts of =
up to 1000 words (excluding bibliography). Please indicate if you intend yo=
ur paper to fit in the open category. The deadline for submissions is 23:59=
 GMT, Sunday, 11th August, 2019. Please submit your abstract through review=
.gamephilosophy.org. All submitted abstracts will be subject to a double-bl=
ind peer review process.=20

Notification of accepted submissions will be sent out in late August 2019. =
A full paper draft must then be submitted by Monday, 14th October 2019 and =
will be made available on the conference website.=20

We also invite proposals for themed panels and workshops that will take pla=
ce on the 20th and 24th October, 2019. Please contact the program committee=
 chair if you are interested in organising one.=20

We cannot provide grants or subsidies for participants. There will, however=
