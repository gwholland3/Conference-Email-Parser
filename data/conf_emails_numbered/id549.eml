You are receiving this because you have registered for one or more of the
co-located conferences (list of conferences is appended to this email for
your reference).

Please note the following TWO requests from conference attendees:

1. Hotel reservation:
   (Ignore this if you have already reserved your room or plan to stay at some
   other hotel.)
   We reserved over 3,500 room nights at the hotel where the conference will
   be held. Our reserved block of rooms at the hotel is close to being fully
   booked. There are only a few more rooms available at the negotiated rate.
   If you plan to stay at the hotel where the conference will be held, you
   would need to do your room reservation within the next few days. In order
   to reserve your room at the conference negotiated rate, use the online
   reservation system at:
   http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp12/ws
   and then select the tab "Location". Or go directly to:
   http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp12/ws/location
   and follow the instructions.

2. Steps you would need to take if you ARE NOT planning to attend the conference:
   (Ignore this if you have already reported to us that you will not be able
   to attend.)

   Authors of accepted papers who have registered but will not be able to attend
   the conference must email us the following information urgently:

   -> I am NOT able to attend the conference in order to present my paper - therefore
           my paper does not need to be scheduled for presentation. Please ship the
           printed books/proceedings to my address.
   -> Your name:
   -> Your paper ID number:
   -> Title of paper:
   -> Your COMPLETE shipping address (including, postal code, city, country, ...):

   We would then arrange for the conference books to be shipped to the above address.
   All shipments will be done in October.


Indications are that we will have a great conference. Prof. David A. Patterson
(Professor of University of California at Berkeley, member of National Academy of
Engineering, member of National of Academy of Sciences, Fellow of IEEE, ACM, and AAAS)
will be opening the conference with his keynote lecture. We will have a number of
tutorials (all tutorials are free to conference registrants) as well as tens of keynotes,
invited talks, together with 100's of presentations. Like other research conference,
the conference program/schedule will be ready one month before the start date of the
conference (we plan to make the conference schedule vailable around June 16th).

We all look forward to seeing you at the conference in July.

Thank you,
Steering Committee
