The Seventh International Conference on Virtual Worlds and Games for Seriou=
s Applications: VS-Games 2015 will be held in Sk=F6vde, Sweden between Sept=
ember 16th and 18th.

VS-Games 2015 aims to meet the challenges of the cross-disciplinary communi=
ty that work around non-leisure applications of games and game technologies=
 by bringing the community together to share knowledge and experiences. In =
2015 we will also aim to bridge the gap between so called serious games and=
 entertainment games. The reason we chose to do this in Sk=F6vde in 2015 is=
 the strong interest of University of Sk=F6vde and Sweden Game Arena in bot=
h areas and we sincerely believe that we can learn from each other.

The conference will explore games and virtual worlds in relation to:


 *   Applications (e.g. case studies, exemplars, practice examples) illustr=
ating the practical usefulness and impact of serious games and virtual worl=
ds
 *   Applications of entertainment games technologies and solutions in non-=
leisure contexts
 *   Methodologies, theories and frameworks (e.g. participatory design meth=
ods, mixed methodologies for data collection and analysis, cross-disciplina=
ry methods)
 *   Evaluation approaches and studies
Full call for papers and other information available from: http://www.his.s=
e/vsgames2015/

Important dates and submission:


 *   Full Paper submission (8 pages): 31st March 2015
 *   Short Paper submission (4 pages): 31st March 2015
 *   Poster Paper submission (2 pages) 31st March 2015
 *   Notification of review results: 5th June, 2015
 *   Camera ready due: 30th June, 2015
Apologies for any cross postings.

Thanks,

Christos
