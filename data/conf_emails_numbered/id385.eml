**HCII 2020: About Copenhagen, capital and largest city of Denmark**

Copenhagen
<https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/sightseeing/summer-copenhagen>
, with a population of more than 1.3 million in the wider urban area,
is regularly top ranked among European cities for quality of life. The
Danish capital is one of the world's greenest, cleanest and most
sustainable urban centers. By having buses and metro running
frequently and around the clock and with more than a third of the
population using cycling as their main transportation for work,
Copenhagen is compact, accessible and a very easy place to explore.

As one of Europe's oldest capitals, hosting the world's oldest
monarchy, Copenhagen is rich in historical buildings and sights, like
the Amalienborg Palace, to get a taste of royal life, the Kronborg
Castle, known worldwide as Hamlet's and Shakespeare's castle, the
Rosenborg Castle in the King's Garden, Tivoli Gardens in the heart of
the city and many more. In addition, many museums offer a wide range
of exhibitions including the Denmark's National Museum, ranging from
Stone Age to modern history, the National Gallery of Denmark and the
Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek.

**IJHCI article: Seven HCI Grand Challenges**

A group of 32 experts involved in the community of the Human Computer
Interaction International (HCII) Conference series have collaborated
to investigate the grand challenges which arise in the current and
emerging landscape of rapid technological evolution towards more
intelligent interactive technologies. The result of this collaboration
is an article published in the International Journal of Human Computer
Interaction (IJHCI, Vol. 35 issue 14, pp. 1229-1269), identifying
seven grand challenges: Human-Technology Symbiosis; Human-Environment
Interactions; Ethics, Privacy and Security; Well-being, Health and
Eudaimonia; Accessibility and Universal Access; Learning and
Creativity; and Social organization and Democracy. The views and
research priorities of this international interdisciplinary group of
experts are summarised, reflecting different scientific perspectives,
methodological approaches and application domains. Each identified
Grand Challenge is analysed in terms of concept and problem
definition, main research issues involved, state of the art,
associated emerging requirements and future research directions.

<h3>IJHCI article: Seven HCI Grand Challenges</h3>
<p>A group of 32 experts involved in the community of the Human Computer In=
teraction International (HCII) Conference series have collaborated to inves=
tigate the grand challenges which arise in the current and emerging landsca=
pe of rapid technological evolution towards more intelligent interactive te=
chnologies. The result of this collaboration is an article published in the=
 International Journal of Human Computer Interaction (IJHCI, Vol. 35 issue =
14, pp. 1229-1269), identifying seven grand challenges: Human-Technology Sy=
mbiosis; Human-Environment Interactions; Ethics, Privacy and Security; Well=
-being, Health and Eudaimonia; Accessibility and Universal Access; Learning=
 and Creativity; and Social organization and Democracy. The views and resea=
rch priorities of this international interdisciplinary group of experts are=
 summarised, reflecting different scientific perspectives, methodological a=
pproaches and application domains. Each identified Grand Challenge is analy=
sed in terms of concept and problem definition, main research issues involv=
ed, state of the art, associated emerging requirements and future research =
directions.</p>
