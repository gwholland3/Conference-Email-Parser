SCOPE AND LIST OF TOPICS:

   PROLOGUE:
   Cyber Warfare adds an additional dimension to warfare. Generally, it
   involves the battlespace use and targeting of computers and networks in
   warfare. Cyber Warfare strategies include both offensive and defensive
   operations pertaining to the threat of cyberattacks, espionage, sabotage,
   disruptions to infrastructures, theft of critical information, and
   publishing deliberate misinformation (fake news and fabricated news)
   spread via traditional media and online social media with the intend to
   mislead in order to disrupt the political processes of nations. The
   methods and technologies utilized in Cyber Warfare can be countered
   using Cyber Defense strategies. Cyber Defense strategies involve the
   heavy and targeted use of Cyber Security. Topics of interest include:

   - Cyber Warfare Technologies and Strategies

PUBLISHER:

   IEEE CPS: https://www.computer.org/conferences/cps 
   All accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the 2019
   International Conference on Computational Science & Computational
   Intelligence ( CSCI: https://americancse.org/events/csci2019 ).
   Since its inception, all CSCI proceedings have always been approved
   and included into IEEE Xplore indexation/digital-library citation
   index databases. Past conference proceedings can be accessed via
   IEEE Xplore Digital Library at:
   Volume I (2014):  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6822065 
   Volume II (2014): https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6822285 
   Volume (2015):    https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/7420813/proceeding 
   Volume (2016):    https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/7879541/proceeding 
   Volume (2017):    https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8554238/proceeding 
   Volune (2018):    Approved & Confirmed for indexation/publication in IEEE Xplore
                     (will appear in IEEE Xplore in October/November, 2019)

   Since the proceedings will be published soon after the conference
   by IEEE CPS, we are quite FLEXIBLE with paper submission deadline.
   WE HAVE A REVOLVING DEADLINE: ie, papers will be refereed within
   48 hours from the date of submission using our fast-track evaluation
   system (FTE) where referees receive a small honorarium pay for their
   services.

TYPE OF SUBMISSIONS/PAPERS (Late Breaking Papers):

 - Full/Regular Research Papers (maximum of 6 pages):
   Regular Research Papers should provide detail original research
   contributions. They must report new research results that represent
   a contribution to the field; sufficient details and support for
   the results and conclusions should also be provided. The work
   presented in regular papers are expected to be at a stage of
   maturity that with some additional work can be published as journal
   papers.

 - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):
   Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should provide
   overall research methodologies with some results. The work presented
   in short papers are expected to be at a stage of maturity that with
   some additional work can be published as regular papers.

 - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):
   Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are still in
   their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such papers tend to
   provide research methodologies without yet concrete results.

REVIEW PROCESS

   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by 2 to 4 peers (except for papers that
   are philosophical in nature - such papers would be considered for panel
   discussions.) Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained.
   Papers will be evaluated on the basis of originality, impact, significance,
   quality of research, quality of writing, and contribution to conference
   program and diversity. Papers whose authors include one or more members
   of the program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded
   review process. Authors whose papers are not selected for publication
   can submit a rebuttal letter; rebuttals will be evaluated by 4 members
   of the Program Committee.
