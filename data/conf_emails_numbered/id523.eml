Please do not let this thread lull any LGBTQ list member into a false sense o=
f security.

It should be noted that since the =E2=80=9CGay Propaganda Law=E2=80=9D was p=
assed in 2013, hate crimes against LGBT people in Russia has more than doubl=
ed. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-lgbt-crime/lgbt-hate-crimes-do=
uble-in-russia-after-ban-on-gay-propaganda-idUSKBN1DL2FM

Foreigners accused of spreading =E2=80=9Cgay propaganda=E2=80=9D (whatever t=
hey determine that means), can face 15 days in prison before being deported,=
 and foreigners can be punished even more harshly if they think you=E2=80=99=
re spreading gay propaganda online:
http://www.globalequality.org/component/content/article/1-in-the-news/186-th=
e-facts-on-lgbt-rights-in-russia

You=E2=80=99ll recall the French couple that was violently beaten IN ST. PET=
ERSBURG during the World Cup (when protection for foreigners was likely stro=
ngest). https://attitude.co.uk/article/gay-world-cup-fan-hospitalised-after-=
violent-homophobic-attack-in-russia/18199/

Again, Human Rights organizations and activists note that homophobic attacks=
 are still on the rise in Russia, even in large cities, and crack-downs by t=
he government are getting worse and more frequent: https://www.reuters.com/a=
rticle/russia-lgbt-attitudes/feature-arrested-and-harrassed-russias-lgbt-com=

Spartacus is perhaps the most world-renowned publication related to travel b=
y the LGBTQ community, and they publish an index for safe travel by country,=
 with Russia appearing near the bottom of the list:
https://spartacus.gayguide.travel/gaytravelindex_2018.pdf

Despite what non-LGBTQ locals may say and what paid travel ads may promise a=
bout travel to St. Petersburg, it is absolutely not safe for LGBTQ people tr=
avel there, so please make a decision to travel there very carefully.=20

> The official law behind LGBT discrimination in Russia is so-called "Russia=
n gay propaganda Law" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_gay_propaganda_l=
aw It prohibits spreading of the information about LGBT among minors. And wh=
ile it is absolutely disgusting, from the practical point of view this law p=
oses no problem for the foreigners coming for an international conference. T=
he only way someone could run into problems is if there would be a person un=
der age of 18 present on the conference, and then someone would file a compl=
aint about him hearing something positive about LGBT. But since conference w=
ould be in English, and most Russians, especially those who support this law=
, do not know this language, I believe that it would be fine.

t? How do computer games fit into established categories or conventions of a=
esthetics, and how do they contribute to new ones? Do games recognised as ha=
ving a claim to artistic status differ from mainstream games? How do account=
s of art based on necessary and sufficient conditions match up against anti-=
essentialist accounts in terms of gauging the status of computer games?=20
>>=20
>> 3. The aesthetics of gaming practices. Are games collaboratively authored=
? How do different kinds of play, or player-game conjunctions, bring about d=
ifferent kinds of gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences? How do differen=
t bodies encounter computer games and what can be said about the way in whic=
h gameplay experience is mediated by our bodies?=20

ference on the Philosophy of Computer Games, organised by the Game Philosop=
hy Network, together with the Centre for Media Philosophy and Laboratory fo=
r Computer Games Research, in St Petersburg, Russia, on October 21=E2=80=93=
24, 2019. </b><br><br>The theme of this year=E2=80=99s conference is <b>=E2=
=80=98The Aesthetics of Computer Games=E2=80=99.</b> Playing games yields p=
articular kinds of playful experiences or perceptions through the senses, w=
hich can be studied with an aesthetic focus, emphasising a=C3=ADsth=C4=93si=
s over no=C3=AAsis. Computer games can be regarded as playful media that or=
ganise our perceptions and modify our sensibilities. For this conference, w=
e welcome submissions on (but not limited to) the following themes and ques=
tions: <br><br><b>1. Aesthetics as aesthesis (a=C3=ADsth=C4=93sis).</b> Is =
there an aesthetics or mode of experience that is specific to computer game=
s? How do their visual, audio, and haptic aspects come together to produce =
distinctive experiences? How are =E2=80=98experience=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98=
perception=E2=80=99 explored in computer games and shaped by them? Can conc=
epts such as =E2=80=98affect=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98atmosphere=E2=80=99, and =
=E2=80=98rhythm=E2=80=99 be productively applied to computer games? What is=
 the role of game interfaces on player experience? <br><br><b>2. Games as a=
rt?</b> What are the conditions of possibility of games being art? How do c=
omputer games fit into established categories or conventions of aesthetics,=
 and how do they contribute to new ones? Do games recognised as having a cl=
aim to artistic status differ from mainstream games? How do accounts of art=
 based on necessary and sufficient conditions match up against anti-essenti=
alist accounts in terms of gauging the status of computer games? <br><br><b=
>3. The aesthetics of gaming practices.</b> Are games collaboratively autho=
red? How do different kinds of play, or player-game conjunctions, bring abo=
ut different kinds of gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences? How do dif=
ferent bodies encounter computer games and what can be said about the way i=
n which gameplay experience is mediated by our bodies? <br>Do some kinds of=
 gameplay or extra-gamic player practices have an aesthetic orientation? Ar=
e computer games performances? <br><br><b>4. The ethical, political, and so=
cial dimensions of game aesthetics.</b> What is the transformative potentia=
l of computer games and how does this compare to the transformative capabil=
ities ascribed to artworks? How do aesthetic issues interconnect with ethic=
al, social, and political ones =E2=80=93 what is the autonomy or heteronomy=
 of the aesthetic domain? How are taste, sensibility, and habit acquired wi=
th respect to gameplay and what are the social implications of this? <br><b=
r>In addition to this central theme, the conference also features an open c=
ategory, for which we invite welcome contributions that do not fit this yea=
r=E2=80=99s theme, but that nonetheless offer a valuable contribution to th=
e philosophy of computer games. <br><br>Submitted proposals should have a c=
lear focus on philosophy and philosophical (including media philosophical) =
issues in relation to computer games. They should also refer to specific ga=
mes rather than invoke them in more general terms. <b>Submissions should be=
 made in the form of extended abstracts of up to 1000 words (excluding bibl=
iography).</b> Please indicate if you intend your paper to fit in the open =
category. <b>The deadline for submissions is 23:59 GMT, Sunday, 11th August=
, 2019.</b> Please submit your abstract through <b><a href=3D"http://review=
.gamephilosophy.org" target=3D"_blank">review.gamephilosophy.org</a>.</b> A=
ll submitted abstracts will be subject to a double-blind peer review proces=
s. <br><br>Notification of accepted submissions will be sent out in late Au=
gust 2019. A full paper draft must then be submitted by Monday, 14th Octobe=
r 2019 and will be made available on the conference website. <br><br><b>We =
also invite proposals for themed panels and workshops that will take place =
on the 20th and 24th October, 2019.</b> Please contact the program committe=
e chair if you are interested in organising one. <br><br><b>We cannot provi=
de grants or subsidies for participants. There will, however, be no confere=
nce fee.</b><br><br>For more information about the conference please visit =
