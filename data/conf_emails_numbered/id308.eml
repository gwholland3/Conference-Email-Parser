   http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp13/ws/registration

D. Financial Assistantship for full-Time Students:

   The congress has finalized the financial assistantship decisions for students
   who are affiliated with non-USA institutions (decisions were communicated
   with the awardees in March and April 2013). Unfortunately, a few of our awardees
   are not able to secure USA visa in a timely manner to attend the meeting. The
   congress is now providing the released funds to full-time graduate students who
   are enrolled in USA institutions. This financial assistantship is for
   attendance only (ie, excludes speakers and authors of papers). Sponsored
   students will receive the complete conference package (printed books/proceedings,
   DVD, dinner reception, 4 breakfasts, 12 refreshments, access to all tracks and
   tutorials, ...), registration fee waiver, possibly with partial help with hotel
   accommodation, and/or possibly some help with airfare. In order to apply, send
   the following information for consideration to sc@world-comp.org as soon as
   possible (include as attachments in pdf only): a 2-page CV; a letter from your
   major professor or Department Head/Chair stating that you are a full-time
   graduate student in good standing; and a break-down of your itemized costs
   (airfare, hotel, ...). Please also provide any matching fund you may be able
   to secure. In the Subject Header of your email write "student sponsorship".
   Award decisions will be finalized within 48 hours of receipt of the requested
   information.

E. Congress Schedules/Programs: (under construction - will be made
   available during the first week of July - either by email or on the web)
