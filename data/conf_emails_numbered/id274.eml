SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them
to the evaluation web site at: 
http://dmin.confmaster.net/pages/login.php?Conf=DMIN . Detailed
information can be found on http://www.dmin-2013.com .
Submissions must be uploaded by March 18, 2013 and must be in either
MS doc or pdf formats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables,
and references - single space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable
typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted
papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting format to
prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have been
previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.
The first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,
affiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The
first page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a
maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content
of the paper. The name of the conference (ie, DMIN) must also be
stated on the first page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word
abstract. The length of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted)
will be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of
contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program
committee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);
often, this would involve seeking help from additional referees.
Papers whose authors include a member of the conference program
committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded review process.
(Essay/philosophical papers will not be refereed but may be considered
for discussion/panels).

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in
science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each
published paper. Science citation databases include: Inspec / IET / The
Institute for Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for
Scientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from
INIST, Datastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN
International); and others. Though, there is no guarantee that the
proceedings will also be included in SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings;
in the past, the proceedings were included in these databases. Therefore,
we will also be sending the proceedings for indexing procedures to SCI EI
Compendex/Elsevier. The printed proceedings/books will be available for
distribution on site at the conference.

In addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with
Elsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)
and another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science
and Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number
of authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the
opportunity to submit the extended version of their papers for publication
in these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books a year in each
of these book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to
Elsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes: Scopus,
Ei village, SCI, ...).

SUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:

Poster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same
instructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except
for the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author
should state that "This paper is being submitted as a poster". Poster
papers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the
accepted paper wishes to do so.


MEMBERS OF PROGRAM AND ORGANIZING COMMITTEES:

The 2013 Program Committee for DMIN conference is currently being
compiled. Many who have already joined the committees are renowned
leaders, scholars, researchers, scientists and practitioners of the
highest ranks; many are directors of research labs., fellows of
various societies, heads/chairs of departments, program directors of
research funding agencies, as well as deans.

Program Committee members are expected to have established a strong and

GENERAL INFORMATION:

DMIN is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,
professionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster 
working relationships and gain access to the latest research results.
It is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of
other research conferences; namely, The 2013 World Congress in Computer
Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing (WORLDCOMP). The
Congress is the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer
science, computer engineering and applied computing. We anticipate to
have 2,100 or more attendees from over 85 countries.

The 2013 Congress will be composed of research presentations, keynote
lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and
poster presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel speakers
have included: Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer, architecture, U. of
California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler (known as Father of
Nanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known as Father of Genetic

An important mission of the Congress is "Providing a unique platform for
a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities
(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also
attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that
have research as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to
achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

One main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of
computer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The
Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary
research initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for
cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.


MEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:

As of December 2012, papers published in the Congress proceedings have
received over 27,000 citations (includes about 2,000 self-citations).
Citation data obtained from http://academic.research.microsoft.com/ .
