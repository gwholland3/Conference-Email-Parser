Call for Papers

5th Automata, Theory and Applications Workshop (*A-PDPTA'13)
(formerly CA-CSC'13)

within the 2013 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed
Processing Techniques and Applications (PDPTA'13)

July 22-25, 2013, Las Vegas, USA

Paper Submission Deadline: March 25, 2013

************************************************************************

Dear Professionals and Research Students working in areas involving both
theory and application fields of computer science, we are inviting you to
join us for our:

5th Automata, Theory and Applications Workshop within The 2013
International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Processing
Techniques and Applications (PDPTA'13): July 22-25, 2013, Tropicana Hotel,
Las Vegas, USA), one of 22 conferences at WORLDCOMP'13 - The 2013 World
Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing.

Chairs of Session: Lou D'Alotto*, J.F. Nystrom**, William Spataro***
    * York College/CUNY and The CUNY Graduate Center, New York, USA,
      ldalotto@gc.cuny.edu
    **Ferris State University, Michigan, USA,
      JamesNystrom@ferris.edu
    ***University of Calabria, Italy,
      spataro@unical.it

Deadline for the full paper submission is March 25, 2013.

OFFICIAL CFP:

Following the success of our previous Cellular Automata, Theory and
Applications Workshop, which included exciting keynotes addressed from
leading Cellular Automata researchers, Prof. Dr. Peter Sloot and Prof.
Yaroslav D. Sergeyev, father of the Infinity Computer; we are glad to
invite you to our fifth edition. From this year, topics of the Workshop
have been extended to the more general Automata theme, including both
theoretical and applicative aspects of this important computer science
field.

The main objective of this Workshop, organized within the 2013 World
Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing
(WORLDCOMP'13), is to offer scientists, researchers and engineers an
opportunity to express and confront their views on trends, challenges, and
state-of-the art in both theory and diverse application fields such as
engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, medicine, ecology,
sociology, traffic control, economy, etc.

Distinguished papers will be published in a special issue of the Journal
of SuperComputing, a leading ISI research journal publishing theoretical,
practical, tutorial and survey papers on all aspects of supercomputing.

Please see other publication details below.

SCOPE: Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- cellular automata
  .  theoretical
  .  systems modeling
  .  other applications

- finite automata

- formal language theory

- theoretical issues on automata theory

- parallel implementations


SUBMISSION:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their draft papers directly to
the Workshop Chairs (see emails above). Please include "*A - PDPTA'13" in
the email subject header. Submissions must be received by March 25, 2013
and they must be in either MS doc (not docx) or pdf formats (about 5 to 7
pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable typesetting
formats are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be
asked to follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their papers for
publication.) The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be
limited to 7 (IEEE style) pages. Papers must not have been previously
published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere. The first page
of the draft paper should include: title of the paper, name, affiliation,
postal address, and email address for each author. The first page should
also identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical
keywords that would best represent the content of the paper. Finally, the
name of the conference (PDPTA'13) must be stated on the first page.

IMPORTANT DATES:

March 25, 2013:   Submission of papers (about 5 to 7 pages)
April 23, 2013:   Notification of decision
May 15, 2013:     Final papers + Copyright + Registration
July 22-25, 2013: The 2013 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer
                  Engineering, and Applied Computing
                  (WORLDCOMP''13 - 22 joint-conferences)
                  http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/ 

CATEGORIES OF ACCEPTED PAPERS:

(RRP)  Regular Research Papers: 7-page IEEE-style publication in the
proceedings. 20-minute formal presentation slot.

(RRR)  Regular Research Reports: 7-page IEEE-style publication in the
proceedings. Presentation in an informal setting (during Discussion
Sessions.) Typically, those authors with language difficulties prefer
this mode of presentation.

(SRP)  Short Research Papers: 4-page IEEE-style publication in the
proceedings. Presentation in an informal setting (during Discussion
Sessions.)  Same presentation mode as RRR papers.

(PST)  Posters 1-page IEEE-style publication in the proceedings.
Presentation in an informal setting (during Discussion Sessions.

PUBLICATION:

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in
science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each
published paper. Science citation databases include: Inspec / IET / The
Institute for Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for
Scientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST,
Datastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN International);
P3P8PCTD138939 and others. Though, there is no guarantee that the
proceedings will also be included in SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings;
in the past, the proceedings were included in these databases. Therefore,
we will also be sending the proceedings for indexing procedures to SCI EI
Compendex/Elsevier. The printed proceedings/books will be available for
distribution on site at the conference.

MORE:

The 5th Automata, Theory and Applications Workshop, together with all
other WORLDCOMP Workshops and Conferences, will be held at Tropicana
Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA (with any overflows at other near-by
hotels). This is a mega hotel with excellent conference facilities.
The hotel is minutes from the airport with 24-hour shuttle service to
and from the airport. This hotel has many recreational attractions.
The negotiated room rate for conference attendees is very reasonable.
