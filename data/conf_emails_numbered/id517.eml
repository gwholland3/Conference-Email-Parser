Dear Gamesnetwork,

I was discussing the issue with a student and indeed worries are inevitable
in this case. At the same time it is important that conferences like this
travel to different parts of the world in order to give easier access to
young scholars (including the local LGBTQIA folks) who might not have
opportunities to travel.

There is no easy solution but we thought that offering the possibility to
present via reliable teleconference channels (which are often available in
many universities) and advertise such possibilities could circumvent the
issue and allow LGBTQIA folks to participate without fear. Ultimately it is
where every conference should be moving anyways.

Best,
*Carl Therrien*

            no problem for the

            run into problems is if there would be a person under age of

            him hearing something

                <p>Dear Dr Parker,</p>
                <p>Thanks for asking a question that may have been on
                  many people=E2=80=99s minds. I have been discussing this =
issue
                  with Alina Latypova, the conference chair. My
                  understanding is that St Petersburg is an
                  international city, and that it is extremely unlikely
                  that there will be any LGBT directed harassment. There
                  also appear to be high levels of support for equal
                  rights for the LGBT community in response to the
                  government=E2=80=99s lamentable position. Of course nobod=
y can
                  give definitive assurances about any city, but I hope
                  that we can offer some reassurances. We have an
                  inclusivity policy that is stated on the website.
                  Anyone is welcome to write to us to continue this

s over
                            no=C3=AAsis. Computer games can be regarded as

                            <br>
                            <b>1. Aesthetics as aesthesis (a=C3=ADsth=C4=93=
sis).</b>
                            Is there an aesthetics or mode of experience
                            that is specific to computer games? How do
                            their visual, audio, and haptic aspects come
                            together to produce distinctive experiences?
                            How are =E2=80=98experience=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=
=98perception=E2=80=99
                            explored in computer games and shaped by
                            them? Can concepts such as =E2=80=98affect=E2=
=80=99,
                            =E2=80=98atmosphere=E2=80=99, and =E2=80=98rhyt=
hm=E2=80=99 be productively
                            applied to computer games? What is the role
                            of game interfaces on player experience? <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>2. Games as art?</b> What are the
                            conditions of possibility of games being
                            art? How do computer games fit into
                            established categories or conventions of
                            aesthetics, and how do they contribute to
                            new ones? Do games recognised as having a
                            claim to artistic status differ from
                            mainstream games? How do accounts of art
                            based on necessary and sufficient conditions
                            match up against anti-essentialist accounts
                            in terms of gauging the status of computer
                            games? <br>

                            <b>3. The aesthetics of gaming practices.</b>
                            Are games collaboratively authored? How do
                            different kinds of play, or player-game
                            conjunctions, bring about different kinds of
                            gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences?
                            How do different bodies encounter computer
                            games and what can be said about the way in
                            which gameplay experience is mediated by our
                            bodies? <br>
                            Do some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic
                            player practices have an aesthetic
                            orientation? Are computer games
                            performances? <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>4. The ethical, political, and social
                              dimensions of game aesthetics.</b> What is
                            the transformative potential of computer
                            games and how does this compare to the
                            transformative capabilities ascribed to
                            artworks? How do aesthetic issues
                            interconnect with ethical, social, and
                            political ones =E2=80=93 what is the autonomy o=
r
                            heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are
                            taste, sensibility, and habit acquired with
                            respect to gameplay and what are the social
                            implications of this? <br>
                            <br>
                            In addition to this central theme, the
                            conference also features an open category,

                            If you need a visa you should apply for it
                            at the Russian consulate in your country or
                            at the visa service (the most popular is <a hre=

                            All visa services have an additional fee.
                            St. Petersburg State University provides
                            attendees with an invitation letter, which
                            helps to obtain the humanitarian visa.
                            Normally the costs of the humanitarian visa
                            is less than the tourist or business one
                            (for German and Polish citizens, for
                            instance, the humanitarian visa is free if
                            they apply for it in the consulate). <br>
