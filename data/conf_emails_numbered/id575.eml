We invite submissions to the <b>13th International Conference on the Philos=
ophy of Computer Games, organised by the Game Philosophy Network, together =
with the Centre for Media Philosophy and Laboratory for Computer Games Rese=
arch, in St Petersburg, Russia, on October 21=E2=80=9324, 2019. </b><br>=20
<br>=20
The theme of this year=E2=80=99s conference is <b>=E2=80=98The Aesthetics o=
f Computer Games=E2=80=99.</b>  Playing games yields particular kinds of pl=
ayful experiences or perceptions through the senses, which can be studied w=
ith an aesthetic focus, emphasising a=C3=ADsth=C4=93sis over no=C3=AAsis. C=
omputer games can be regarded as playful media that organise our perception=
s and modify our sensibilities. For this conference, we welcome submissions=
 on (but not limited to) the following themes and questions: <br>=20
<br>
<b>1. Aesthetics as aesthesis (a=C3=ADsth=C4=93sis).</b> Is there an aesthe=
tics or mode of experience that is specific to computer games? How do their=
 visual, audio, and haptic aspects come together to produce distinctive exp=
eriences? How are =E2=80=98experience=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98perception=E2=
=80=99 explored in computer games and shaped by them? Can concepts such as =
=E2=80=98affect=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98atmosphere=E2=80=99, and =E2=80=98rhythm=
=E2=80=99 be productively applied to computer games? What is the role of ga=
me interfaces on player experience? <br>=20
<br>
<b>2. Games as art?</b> What are the conditions of possibility of games bei=
ng art? How do computer games fit into established categories or convention=
s of aesthetics, and how do they contribute to new ones? Do games recognise=
d as having a claim to artistic status differ from mainstream games? How do=
 accounts of art based on necessary and sufficient conditions match up agai=
nst anti-essentialist accounts in terms of gauging the status of computer g=
ames? <br>=20
<br>
<b>3. The aesthetics of gaming practices.</b> Are games collaboratively aut=
hored? How do different kinds of play, or player-game conjunctions, bring a=
bout different kinds of gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences? How do d=
ifferent bodies encounter computer games and what can be said about the way=
 in which gameplay experience is mediated by our bodies? <br>
=20
Do some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic player practices have an aesthetic=
 orientation? Are computer games performances? <br>
<br>
<b>4. The ethical, political, and social dimensions of game aesthetics.</b>=
 What is the transformative potential of computer games and how does this c=
ompare to the transformative capabilities ascribed to artworks? How do aest=
hetic issues interconnect with ethical, social, and political ones =E2=80=
=93 what is the autonomy or heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are tas=
te, sensibility, and habit acquired with respect to gameplay and what are t=
he social implications of this? <br>
<br>
In addition to this central theme, the conference also features an open cat=
egory, for which we invite welcome contributions that do not fit this year=
=E2=80=99s theme, but that nonetheless offer a valuable contribution to the=
 philosophy of computer games. <br>
<br>
Submitted proposals should have a clear focus on philosophy and philosophic=
al (including media philosophical) issues in relation to computer games. Th=
ey should also refer to specific games rather than invoke them in more gene=
ral terms. <b>Submissions should be made in the form of extended abstracts =
of up to 1000 words (excluding bibliography).</b> Please indicate if you in=
tend your paper to fit in the open category. <b>The deadline for submission=
s is 23:59 GMT, Sunday, 11th August, 2019.</b> Please submit your abstract =
through <b>review.gamephilosophy.org.</b> All submitted abstracts will be s=
ubject to a double-blind peer review process. <br>
<br>
Notification of accepted submissions will be sent out in late August 2019. =
A full paper draft must then be submitted by Monday, 14th October 2019 and =
will be made available on the conference website. <br>
<br>
<b>We also invite proposals for themed panels and workshops that will take =
place on the 20th and 24th October, 2019.</b> Please contact the program co=
mmittee chair if you are interested in organising one. <br>
<br>
<b>We cannot provide grants or subsidies for participants. There will, howe=
ver, be no conference fee.</b><br>
