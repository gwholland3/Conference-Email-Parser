ps.
-> ICAI'12 paper acceptance rate has been 27% (as of May 4, 2012); this does
   not yet reflect the data for all individual sessions (ie, the acceptance rate
   is likely to change).
-> See the appended text for useful information about the conference.
-> If at least one author of an accepted paper registers for the conference
   but for some reason he/she is unable to attend the conference, then
   his/her paper will be published and arrangements would be made to ship
   the proceedings to the registered author after the conference. However,
   the registered author MUST inform us by no later than June 10 that he/she
   will not be able to attend.

PUBLICATION:

Proceedings of ICAI will be published in printed (ISBN) conference
books/proceedings and will also be made available online. The proceedings
will be indexed in science citation databases that track citation
frequency/data for each paper; such databases include: Inspec / IET /
The Institute for Engineering and Technology; The French National Center
for Scientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (covers the core
scientific literature in Science; about 90% of inclusions are journals;
only about 9% are proceedings; this congress tracks are selected to be among
the 9% - accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit,
Qwam, and STN International); and others. Though, there is no guarantee that
the proceedings will also be included in EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings, in
the past various tracks of ICAI were included in these databases.
Therefore, we will also be sending the proceedings for indexing procedures
to EI Compendex/Elsevier. The printed proceedings/books will be available
for distribution on site at the conference. Like prior years, extended
versions of selected papers will appear in journals and edited research
books (a large number of book projects and journal special issues are in
the pipeline: Springer, Elsevier, BMC journals, ...) Authors of selected
papers will be given the opportunity to submit the extended versions of
their papers for consideration; this process will start soon after October
2012.


GENERAL INFORMATION:

ICAI conference is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a
number of other federated research conferences. This federated congress
is the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer science, computer
engineering and applied computing. We anticipate to have about 2,000
attendees from over 80 countries. The congress will be composed of research
presentations, keynote lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel
discussions, and poster presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel
speakers have included: Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer, architecture, U.
of California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler (known as Father of
Nanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known as Father of Genetic Algorithms;
U. of Michigan), Prof. Ian Foster (known as Father of Grid Computing; U. of
Chicago & ANL), Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (pioneer, VR, U. of California, Berkeley),
Prof. Barry Vercoe (Founding member of MIT Media Lab, MIT), Dr. Jim Gettys
(known as X-man, developer of X Window System, xhost; OLPC), Prof. John Koza
(known as Father of Genetic Programming, Stanford U.), Prof. Brian D. Athey
(NIH Program Director, U. of Michigan), Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna (pioneer, U.
of Southern California), Dr. Jose L. Munoz (NSF Program Director and
Consultant), Prof. Jun Liu (pioneer, Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard U.),
Prof. Lotfi A. Zadeh (Father of Fuzzy Logic), Dr. Firouz Naderi (Head, NASA
Mars Exploration Program/2000-2005 and Associate Director, Project Formulation
and Strategy, Jet Propulsion Lab, CalTech/NASA; Director, NASA's JPL Solar
System Exploration), Prof. David Lorge Parnas (Fellow of IEEE, ACM, RSC, CAE,
GI; Dr.h.c.: ETH Zurich, Prof. Emeritus, McMaster U. and U. of Limerick),
Prof. Eugene H. Spafford (Executive Director, CERIAS and Professor, Purdue
University), Dr. Sandeep Chatterjee (Vice President & Chief Technology Officer,
SourceTrace Systems, Inc.), and many other distinguished speakers. To get a
feeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see the 2011 delegates photos
available at: http://worldcomp.phanfare.com/5408606

An important mission of the congress is "Providing a unique platform for a
diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers, developers,
educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted effort to reach out
to participants affiliated with diverse entities (such as: universities,
institutions, corporations, government agencies, and research centers/labs)
from all over the world. The congress also attempts to connect participants
from institutions that have teaching as their main mission with those who are
affiliated with institutions that have research as their main mission. The
congress uses a quota system to achieve its institution and geography diversity
objectives."

One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated research meeting held
in a common place at a common time. This model facilitates communication among
researchers in different fields of computer science, computer engineering, and
applied computing. The Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary and
inter-disciplinary research initiatives; ie, facilitating increased
opportunities for cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.
