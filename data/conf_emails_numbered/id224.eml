already submitted papers in response to earlier "Call For Papers" should
IGNORE this announcement. (Those who have been notified that their papers have
been accepted, MUST still follow the instructions that were emailed to them;
including meeting the deadlines mentioned in the notifications that were sent
to them).

INVITATION:
You are invited to submit a "Late Breaking Paper", "Position Paper", or

DMIN'14 CONFERENCE CHAIR:

   Dr. Robert Stahlbock
   University of Hamburg, Germany
   conference-chair@dmin-2014.com
   (General Conference Chair)


SUBMISSION OF LATE BREAKING PAPERS, POSITION PAPERS, ABSTRACTS/POSTERS:

In response to this announcement, authors are given the opportunity to submit
their papers for evaluation in one of the following three categories:

   1. Late Breaking Papers: describe late-breaking/recent developments in
      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the following
      on the first page of your submission "DMIN: LATE BREAKING PAPER".
      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited
      to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the
      opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.

   2. Position Papers: enable discussions on emerging topics without the
      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,
      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward
      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.
      The maximum number of pages is 4. Please write the following on the
      first page of your submission "DMIN: POSITION PAPER".
      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited
      to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the
      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.

   3. Abstract/Poster Papers: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD
      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please
      write the following on the first page of your submission
      "DMIN: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER".
      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited
      to 2 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the
      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers (see above for paper
categories) by uploading them to the evaluation web site at:
http://dmin.confmaster.net/ 

Submissions must be uploaded by June 5, 2014 and must be in either
MS doc or pdf formats (single space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable
typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers
will be asked to follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their
final papers for publication.) Papers must not have been previously
published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere. The first
page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name, affiliation,
postal address, and email address for each author. The first page should
also identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical
keywords that would best represent the content of the paper. The name
of the conference that the paper is being submitted for consideration
(i.e., DMIN) must also be stated on the first page of the paper as well
as a 100 to 150-word abstract. The length of the final/Camera-Ready
papers (if accepted) will be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.

Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, and
soundness. Each paper will be refereed by two researchers in the topical
area. To reflect upon feedback from last year we will extend the
constructive feedback given within the review. Please consult the pages
for the Review Process ( http://www.dmin-2014.com/DMIN2014/review.htm )
for additional Information.

We particularly encourage submissions of industrial applications and case
studies from practitioners. To reflect the requirements of an application
or project centric case study presentation, these will be subject to
different review criteria. In particular, they will not be evaluated using
predominantly theoretical research criteria of originality etc., but will
take general interest and presentation stronger into consideration.

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and will
also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in science
citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each published
paper. Science citation databases include: relevant Elsevier indexing
products (SCI Elsevier products include, among others: Scopus,
www.info.scopus.com; Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE,
www.info.embase.com; and others); Inspec / IET / The Institute for
Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for Scientific Research,
CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog,
EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN International); and others.

Note that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement, will
have their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the Final Edition
of the conference proceedings which will go to press soon after the conference
(the conference would then make the necessary arrangements to ship the printed
proceedings/books to such authors). The Final Edition of the conference
proceedings will be identical to earlier edition except for a number of
sections/chapters appended to the proceedings/book.


IMPORTANT DATES:

June 5, 2014:       Submission of papers for evaluation (the sooner, a submission
                    is received, the earlier, the notification will be sent out.)

                    week after the paper has been submitted.

                    will be published in the Final Edition of the proceedings which
                    will go to press soon after the conference; they will also be
                    indexed in science citation index databases.)

An important mission of The Congress is "Providing a unique platform for
a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities
(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also
attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that
have research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to
achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer
science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also
encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;
ie, facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across
sub-disciplines.

TUTORIALS:

All tutorials are free to conference registrants, the list of tutorials
that have been approved so far can be found at:
http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp14/ws/tutorials
We plan to offer more tutorials (in addition to what is already posted on
the web). As of the writing of this announcement, the following tutorials
have been approved and they will be presented by distinguished speakers:


O. Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET)
