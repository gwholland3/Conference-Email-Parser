ACM Transactions on Social Computing (TSC) seeks to publish work that cover=
s the full spectrum of social computing including theoretical, empirical, s=
ystems, and design research contributions. The editorial perspective is tha=
t social computing is fundamentally about computing systems and techniques =
in which users interact, directly or indirectly, with what they believe to =
be other users or other users' contributions. TSC welcomes research employi=
ng a wide range of methods to advance the tools, techniques, understanding,=
 and practice of social computing, including: theoretical, algorithmic, emp=
irical, experimental, qualitative, quantitative, ethnographic, design, and =
engineering research. Social computing will continue to be shaped by founda=
tional algorithmic, econometric, psychological, sociological, and social sc=
ience research and these broad based perspectives will continue to have a p=
rofound influence on how social computing systems are designed, built and h=
ow they grow.   =20
   =20
TSC particularly solicits research that designs, implements or studies syst=
ems that mediate social interactions among users, or that develops or studi=
es theory or techniques for application in those systems. Examples of such =
social computing systems include, but are not limited to: instant messaging=
, blogs, wikis, social networks, social tagging, social recommenders, colla=
borative editors and shared repositories.  =20
  =20
To illustrate the scope, we provide examples of research covered within TSC=
