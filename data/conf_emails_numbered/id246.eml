INDEXING:
The proceedings/books of this conference have been evaluated and approved
for inclusion into science citation index / SCI databases. We are happy
to report that the evaluation board of science citation index databases
have APPROVED the indexing, integrating, and inclusion of the ICAI
proceedings into relevant Elsevier indexing databases (Elsevier indexing
databases include, among others: Scopus, www.info.scopus.com; SCI
Compendex, Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com;
and others). In addition, the proceedings will also be indexed by a
number of other science citation databases that track citation
frequency/data for each paper.

INVITATION:
You are invited to submit a full paper for consideration. All accepted
papers will be published in printed conference books/proceedings (ISBN)
and will also be made available online. Like prior years, extended
versions of selected papers (about 35%) will appear in journals and edited
research books (publishers include: Springer, Elsevier, BMC, and others).
In addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with
Elsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)
and another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science

MEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:

As of March 14, 2013, papers published in Congress proceedings that
ICAI is part of, have received 27,591 citations (includes 3,342
self-citations). Citation data obtained from
http://academic.research.microsoft.com/ .


SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them
to the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org .
Submissions must be uploaded by April 20, 2013 and must be in either
MS doc or pdf formats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables,
and references - single space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable
typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted
papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting format to
prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have been
previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.
The first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,
affiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The
first page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a
maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content
of the paper. The name of the conference (ie, ICAI) must also be
stated on the first page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word
abstract. The length of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted)
will be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of
contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program
committee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);
often, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers
whose authors include a member of the conference program committee will
be evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Papers deemed
to be philosophical, essay type, or about controversial topics/applications
will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels/presentation).

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in
science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each
published paper. Science citation databases include: relevant Elsevier
indexing products (SCI Elsevier products include, among others: Scopus,
www.info.scopus.com; Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE,
www.info.embase.com; and others); Inspec / IET / The Institute for
Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for Scientific Research,
CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog,
EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN International); and others.
The printed proceedings/books will be available for distribution on
site at the conference - online/soft versions will also be made available
world-wide.

In addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with
Elsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)
and another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science
and Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number
of authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the opportunity
to submit the extended version of their papers for publication consideration
in these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books a year in each
of these book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to
Elsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes: Scopus,
Ei village, SCI, ...).

SUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:

Poster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same
instructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except
for the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author
should state that "This paper is being submitted as a poster". Poster
papers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the
accepted paper wishes to do so.


GENERAL INFORMATION:

ICAI is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,
professionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster
working relationships and gain access to the latest research results.
It is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of
other research conferences; namely, The 2013 World Congress in Computer
Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing (WORLDCOMP). The
Congress is the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer
science, computer engineering and applied computing. We anticipate to
have 2,100 or more attendees from over 85 countries.

The 2013 Congress will be composed of research presentations, keynote
lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and
poster presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel speakers
have included: Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer, architecture, U. of
California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler (known as Father of
Nanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known as Father of Genetic
Algorithms; U. of Michigan), Prof. Ian Foster (known as Father of Grid
Computing; U. of Chicago & ANL), Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (pioneer, VR, U.
of California, Berkeley), Prof. Barry Vercoe (Founding member of MIT
Media Lab, MIT), Dr. Jim Gettys (known as X-man, developer of X Window
System, xhost; OLPC), Prof. John Koza (known as Father of Genetic
Programming, Stanford U.), Prof. Brian D. Athey (NIH Program Director,
U. of Michigan), Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna (pioneer, U. of Southern
California), Dr. Jose L. Munoz (NSF Program Director and Consultant),
Prof. Jun Liu (pioneer, Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard U.),
Prof. Lotfi A. Zadeh (Father of Fuzzy Logic), Dr. Firouz Naderi (Head,
NASA Mars Exploration Program/2000-2005 and Associate Director, Project
Formulation & Strategy, Jet Propulsion Lab, CalTech/NASA; Director,
NASA's JPL Solar System Exploration), Prof. David Lorge Parnas (Fellow
of IEEE, ACM, RSC, CAE, GI; Dr.h.c.: ETH Zurich, Prof. Emeritus,
McMaster U. and U. of Limerick), Prof. Eugene H. Spafford (Executive
Director, CERIAS and Professor, Purdue University), Dr. Sandeep
Chatterjee (Vice President & Chief Technology Officer, SourceTrace
Systems, Inc.), Prof. Haym Hirsh (Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA
and former director of Division of Information and Intelligent Systems,
National Science Foundation, USA), Dr. Flavio Villanustre (Vice-
President, HPCC Systems), and many other distinguished speakers. To

An important mission of the Congress is "Providing a unique platform for
a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities
(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The Congress also
attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that
have research as their main mission. The Congress uses a quota system to
achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

One main goal of the Congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of
computer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The
Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary
research initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for
cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.
