KEY FEATURES: this book will

O. Provide a multidisciplinary approach to security with coverage of
   communication systems, information mining, policy making, and management
   infrastructures.
O. Discuss deployment of numerous security solutions, including, cyber defense
   techniques and defense against malicious code and mobile attacks.

DESCRIPTION:

EMERGING TRENDS IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICT) SECURITY,
an edited book volume, discusses the foundations and theoretical aspects of
ICT security; covers trends, analytics, assessments and frameworks necessary
for performance analysis and evaluation; and provides the state-of-the-art
knowledge needed for successful deployment of security solutions in many
environments. Application scenarios will provide, with an insider's look,
security solutions deployed in real-life scenarios, including but not limited
to smart devices, biometrics, social media, big data security, and crowd
sourcing. The book is structured in four sections:

Part I:   Foundations and theoretical aspects of ICT security
Part II:  Trends, analytics, assessments and frameworks
Part III: Implementation and deployment
Part IV:  Application Scenarios

RECOMMENDED TOPICS AND THEMES:

In the context of ICT and security, topics of interest include, but are not
limited to, the following:

Part I:   Foundations and theoretical aspects of ICT security
          This part will address the theories and concept which underpin various
          aspect of ICT (information and communications technologies).
          Part I core topics include:
          -> Networks and security requirements
          -> Information warfare
          -> Privacy
          -> Authentication, authorization and access
          -> Cryptography, cryptosystems and watermarking
          -> Cyber security management
          -> Critical infrastructure
          -> Policies
          -> Intrusion detection systems
          -> Security theories and practices for internet based solutions
          -> Countering and reducing ICT security risks
          -> Foundation of cloud security
          -> Enterprise security modelling

PART II:  Trends, analytics, assessments and frameworks
          This part will address analytical and evaluative frameworks, tools and
          concepts needed for understanding of security related issues in ICT
          context.
          Part II core Topics include:
          -> Performance analysis and evaluation
          -> Information assurances
          -> System certification
          -> Cyber security education
          -> Mission assurance and critical infrastructure
          -> Allied technologies
          -> Legal and ethical frameworks
          -> Security and threat assessment frameworks

Part III: Implementation and deployment
          This part will address the realization of security concepts. It provides
          the reader with the state of the art knowledge needed for successful
          deployment of a security solution.
          Part III core Topics include:
          -> Management of infrastructures
          -> Malicious code
          -> Cyber defense deployment
          -> Novel secrecy methods

IMPORTANT DATES:

June 16, 2013:      Submission of papers/chapters for evaluation
July 1, 2013:       Notification of acceptance/not-acceptance
July 12, 2013:      Submission of typeset final papers/chapters for publication
                    + signed Copyright Agreements

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them to
the evaluation web site at:
http://world-comp.org/elsevier-morgan-kaufman-ICT/ 
Submissions must be uploaded by June 16, 2013 and must be in either MS doc
or pdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable: 11 to 12 as
font size, single line spacing (later, the authors of accepted papers will
be asked to follow a particular elsevier typesetting format to prepare their
final papers for publication.) Papers must not have been previously published
or currently submitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper
should include: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and
email address for each author. The first page should also identify the name
of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best
represent the content of the paper. The first page should also include an
abstract of about 100 to 150 words. Each submission is anticipated to be
about 10 pages long (including: references, figures, tables, ...).

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by the editorial board for originality,
significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. Chief Editors will be advised
and supported by an International Editorial Advisory Board consisting of
leading specialized experts from the academia and industry.

The book will be published by Elsevier (Morgan Kaufmann) and so all
