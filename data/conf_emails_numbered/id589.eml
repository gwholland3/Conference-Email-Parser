Dear All,



It is my pleasure to announce the *7th Games and Literary Theory Conference=
*
(GamesLit 2019) to be held in Kolkata, India  on *November 18th to 20th*.
The venue is Presidency University, Kolkata (formerly Hindoo College and
Presidency College), which has just celebrated its bicentenary. It is an
honour to be able to host the first large games conference in this part of
Asia and indeed, the so-named Global South.



Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), also known as the 'second city of the British
Empire, used to be the capital of the British Raj and is now a vibrant and
diverse city with a rich mix of cultures. It is also an appropriate
location for a conference themed* 'Games at the Margin'*. The full call for
papers is available on the conference website:
https://gameslit2019.wordpress.com and also below.



We are looking for *abstracts of at least 300 and no more than. 700 words*;
more information is available on the conference website.  Please submit
your abstracts via EasyChair at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dgameslit2019 on or before *June
30th*.



More information on the travel, accommodation and other logistical issues
will be provided on the website shortly. If you have any queries, please
email me at *souvik.eng@presiuniv.ac.in <souvik.eng@presiuniv.ac.in>* or my
coorganiser at *debanjana.eng@presiuniv.ac.in
<debanjana.eng@presiuniv.ac.in>.*



Looking forward to welcoming you to GamesLit @ Kolkata.

Thanks and regards,

Souvik

Call for Papers

Videogames have grown into a global socio-cultural phenomenon and are now a
primary concern of Literary and Cultural Studies as well as the Social
Sciences. In a medium that sweeps across geographies (including virtual
ones), however, the discourse usually privileges a certain section  when it
comes to the representation of identity. In a medium, where roleplaying and
playing in character is of prime importance, such an ignoring of the
marginal and the diverse is indeed problematic.

In one of the first books on the subject, Adrienne Shaw says =E2=80=98Teach=
ing
classes on minority representation in games, I heard this refrain repeated
yet again by my students. Video games are a niche medium; they are fantasy
environments; and they are designed for a narrow market. Of course games
are not diverse=E2=80=94so what? [=E2=80=A6] I realized that I recognized m=
yself in my
participants=E2=80=99 responses. After all, I too grew up playing a medium =
for
which I was not the primary market and media in which only certain aspects
of my identity were ever shown=E2=80=99 (Shaw 2015). Shaw=E2=80=99s concern=
 is an urgent
one and recent events related to racism, sexism and other kinds of
discrimination in the videogame industry and in the content of the games,
highlights the importance of academic dialogues around gaming =E2=80=98at t=
he
margins=E2=80=99, as it were.

These concerns, of course, echo much older debates on diversity and
difference in Literary and Cultural Studies. Identity and indeed, even the
body, are constructs in the Foucauldian framework of biopower and beyond
the actual control of individuals. Thinkers such as Judith Butler, Julia
Kristeva and bell hooks point out how the the body is marginalised based on
gender, race and class. Similarly, the constructedness of the =E2=80=98Orie=
nt=E2=80=99 and
the =E2=80=98Oriental=E2=80=99 in colonial discourse as shown by Edward Sai=
d and also how
the colonial system also renders certain groups of people =E2=80=98subalter=
n=E2=80=99 and
how this affects the discourse of diversity as Gayatri Chakravarty Spivak
and Homi Bhabha make evident. Often, the discourse of diversity and the
margins pervades games as well although the connection is not often made
evident in the older and more traditional disciplines.

Recent games scholarship has started addressing issues of diversity in
games through the new Diversity Group that is now part of the Digital Games
Research Association (DiGRA), books on gender, race and colonialism (Shaw
2015; Murray 2018; Mukherjee 2017) as well as edited journal issues and
panel discussions. As crucial to discussions of both games and literary
theory, these issues form the main theme of this year=E2=80=99s Games and L=
iterary
Theory Conference, being held in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), India.

We welcome papers on but not restricted to the following topics:

   - Representations of diverse games in literature.
   - Remediating marginality: from non-canonical literature to games.
   - Studying games with literary theory: from the center to the margins.
   - Marginalized discourses of gaming culture.
   - Digital and non-digital games as tools to resist inequality and
   erasure.
   - Representations of gender, queerness, race, class and caste in games
   vis a vis literature.
   - Colonization,  migration and diasporas in understanding game spaces.
   - cis-heteropatriarchal gender norms and gaming.
   - The language of the =E2=80=9Cdigital frontier=E2=80=9D in gaming and t=
ech cultures
   - Diversity practices and games studies.
   - Empathy games that engage with racism and the =E2=80=98refugee=E2=80=
=99 experience.
   - Decolonizing struggles in the gaming industry around labour and money
   - Digital Humanities from the margins vis a vis gamer culture in Global
   North vs. the Global South.
