INVITATION:

   You are invited to submit a paper for consideration. All accepted
   papers will be published by IEEE CPS in the proceedings of The
   2019 International Conference on Computational Science and
   Computational Intelligence (CSCI). Extended versions of selected
   papers of the conference will also appear in journals and edited
   research books (Springer, Elsevier, BMC, ...) The published
   proceedings can be accessed via web portals, IEEE CPS, other
   Digital libraries.

   CSCI'19 International Conference is composed of a number of
   symposiums, sessions, workshops, posters and panel discussions;
   all will be held simultaneously, same location and dates:
   December 5-7, 2019.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF PAPERS FOR EVALUATION:

   All accepted papers will be published by IEEE CPS:
   https://www.computer.org/conferences/cps 
   in the proceedings of The 2019 International Conference on
   Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI'19).

   Papers should be typeset by using the general typesetting
   instructions available at:
   https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
   (i.e., use of regular Times New Roman, font size of 10, single
   line spacing, 2-column format). Authors of accepted papers
   will later receive more specific typesetting instructions. All
   submissions must be original (papers must not have been
   previously published or currently being considered by others
   for publication).

   Submissions must be in either MS doc or pdf formats (6 pages
   for Regular Research Papers; 4 pages for Short Papers; 2 pages
   for Poster Papers - the number of pages include all figures,
   tables, and references). The first page should include:

   - Title of the paper.
   - Name, affiliation, city, country, and email address of each
     author (identify the name of the Contact Author).
   - Abstract (about 100 words).
   - A maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the
     work described in the paper.
   - Write the type of the submission as "Full/Regular Research
     Papers", "Short Papers", or "Poster Papers".
   - Write the acronym of the most relevant symposium that this
     paper is being submitted to - the acronyms are:
        Computational Science (CSCI-ISCS); Computational
        Intelligence (CSCI-ISCI); Cyber Warfare, Cyber Defense, &
        Cyber Security (CSCI-ISCW); Signal & Image Processing,
        Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition (CSCI-ISPC); Smart
        Cities and Smart Mobility (CSCI-ISSC); Education
        (CSCI-ISED); Health Informatics and Medical Systems
        (CSCI-ISHI); Mobile Computing, Wireless Networks, &
        Security (CSCI-ISMC); Software Engineering (CSCI-ISSE);
        Internet of Things & Internet of Everything (CSCI-ISOT);
        Big Data and Data Science (CSCI-ISBD); Artificial
        Intelligence (CSCI-ISAI); Social Network Analysis, Social
        Media, & Mining (CSCI-ISNA); Cloud Computing and Data
        Centers (CSCI-ISCC); Computational Biology (CSCI-ISCB);
        and Parallel & Distributed Computing (CSCI-ISPD).
        See https://americancse.org/events/csci2019/Symposiums 
        for more details.

   The actual paper can start from the first page (space permitting).
   Submissions are to be uploaded to the submission/evaluation web
   site portal at: https://american-cse.org/ 


TYPE OF SUBMISSIONS/PAPERS:

  - Full/Regular Research Papers (maximum of 6 pages):
    Regular Research Papers should provide detail original research
    contributions. They must report new research results that
    represent a contribution to the field; sufficient details and
    support for the results and conclusions should also be provided.
    The work presented in regular papers are expected to be at a
    stage of maturity that with some additional work can be
    published as journal papers.

  - Short Papers (maximum of 4 pages):
    Short papers report on ongoing research projects. They should
    provide overall research methodologies with some results. The
    work presented in short papers are expected to be at a stage of
    maturity that with some additional work can be published as
    regular papers.

  - Poster Papers (maximum of 2 pages):
    Poster papers report on ongoing research projects that are
    still in their infancy (i.e., at very early stages). Such
    papers tend to provide research methodologies without yet
    concrete results.


REVIEW PROCESS

   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by 2 to 4 peers (except for
   papers that are philosophical in nature - such papers would be
   considered for panel discussions.) Confidentiality of submitted
   material will be maintained.  Papers will be evaluated on the
   basis of originality, impact, significance, quality of research,
   quality of writing, and contribution to conference program and
   diversity. Papers whose authors include one or more members of
   the program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded
   review process. Authors whose papers are not selected for
   publication can submit a rebuttal letter; rebuttals will be
   evaluated by 4 members of the Program Committee.
