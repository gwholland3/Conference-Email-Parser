Dear Dr Parker,

Thanks for asking a question that may have been on many people=E2=80=99s mi=
nds. I
have been discussing this issue with Alina Latypova, the conference chair.
My understanding is that St Petersburg is an international city, and that
it is extremely unlikely that there will be any LGBT directed harassment.
There also appear to be high levels of support for equal rights for the
LGBT community in response to the government=E2=80=99s lamentable position.=
 Of
course nobody can give definitive assurances about any city, but I hope
that we can offer some reassurances. We have an inclusivity policy that is
stated on the website. Anyone is welcome to write to us to continue this
discussion: feng.zhu@kcl.ac.uk

Kind regards,

Feng

<p>Thanks for asking a question that may have been on many people=E2=80=99s=

      We invite submissions to the <b>13th International Conference on
        the Philosophy of Computer Games, organised by the Game
        Philosophy Network, together with the Centre for Media
        Philosophy and Laboratory for Computer Games Research, in St
        Petersburg, Russia, on October 21=E2=80=9324, 2019. </b><br>
      <br>
      The theme of this year=E2=80=99s conference is <b>=E2=80=98The Aesthe=
tics of
        Computer Games=E2=80=99.</b> Playing games yields particular kinds =
of
      playful experiences or perceptions through the senses, which can
      be studied with an aesthetic focus, emphasising a=C3=ADsth=C4=93sis o=
ver
      no=C3=AAsis. Computer games can be regarded as playful media that
      organise our perceptions and modify our sensibilities. For this
      conference, we welcome submissions on (but not limited to) the
      following themes and questions: <br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Aesthetics as aesthesis (a=C3=ADsth=C4=93sis).</b> Is there an
      aesthetics or mode of experience that is specific to computer
      games? How do their visual, audio, and haptic aspects come
      together to produce distinctive experiences? How are =E2=80=98experie=
nce=E2=80=99
      and =E2=80=98perception=E2=80=99 explored in computer games and shape=
d by them?
      Can concepts such as =E2=80=98affect=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98atmosphere=E2=
=80=99, and =E2=80=98rhythm=E2=80=99 be
      productively applied to computer games? What is the role of game
      interfaces on player experience? <br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Games as art?</b> What are the conditions of possibility of
      games being art? How do computer games fit into established
      categories or conventions of aesthetics, and how do they
      contribute to new ones? Do games recognised as having a claim to
      artistic status differ from mainstream games? How do accounts of
      art based on necessary and sufficient conditions match up against
      anti-essentialist accounts in terms of gauging the status of
      computer games? <br>
      <br>
      <b>3. The aesthetics of gaming practices.</b> Are games
      collaboratively authored? How do different kinds of play, or
      player-game conjunctions, bring about different kinds of gaming
      pleasures or aesthetic experiences? How do different bodies
      encounter computer games and what can be said about the way in
      which gameplay experience is mediated by our bodies? <br>
      Do some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic player practices have an
      aesthetic orientation? Are computer games performances? <br>
      <br>
      <b>4. The ethical, political, and social dimensions of game
        aesthetics.</b> What is the transformative potential of computer
      games and how does this compare to the transformative capabilities
      ascribed to artworks? How do aesthetic issues interconnect with
      ethical, social, and political ones =E2=80=93 what is the autonomy or
      heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are taste, sensibility,
      and habit acquired with respect to gameplay and what are the
      social implications of this? <br>
      <br>
      In addition to this central theme, the conference also features an
      open category, for which we invite welcome contributions that do
      not fit this year=E2=80=99s theme, but that nonetheless offer a valua=
ble
      contribution to the philosophy of computer games. <br>
      <br>
      Submitted proposals should have a clear focus on philosophy and
      philosophical (including media philosophical) issues in relation
      to computer games. They should also refer to specific games rather
      than invoke them in more general terms. <b>Submissions should be
        made in the form of extended abstracts of up to 1000 words
        (excluding bibliography).</b> Please indicate if you intend your
      paper to fit in the open category. <b>The deadline for
        submissions is 23:59 GMT, Sunday, 11th August, 2019.</b> Please
      submit your abstract through <b><a href=3D"http://review.gamephilosop=
