Background:   =20
    =20
The rapid proliferation of computing technologies has led to modern society=
's irreversible reliance on complex information systems (IS) to execute day=
-to-day operations. Unfortunately, these systems often contain numerous vul=
nerabilities that allow malicious hackers from across the globe to circumve=
nt cybersecurity controls and manipulate them in a fashion not intended by =
the developer. These cyber-attacks result in hundreds of billions of dollar=
s of loss and jeopardize the privacy of hundreds of millions of citizens. I=
ncreasingly sophisticated attack methods developed and used by cyber crimin=
als and the growing role of outdated cyberinfrastructure and malicious insi=
ders in several recent large-scale security breaches clearly indicate that =
traditional reactive approaches to information security and privacy can no =
longer keep up. Analytics is the key element in enhancing cyber resilience.=
 To date, numerous social media analytics, stream data mining, social netwo=
rk analysis, and adversarial modeling, have been applied on terabytes of he=
terogeneous data ranging from the traditional internal server and applicati=
on logs for vulnerability and risk assessment, to the emerging external adv=
ersarial hacker community (i.e., Dark Web) threats for proactive cyber thre=
at intelligence (CTI). However, the highly dynamic threat landscape necessi=
tates the development of novel analytics to quickly sift through large quan=
tities of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data to identify pa=
tterns, emerging threats, and key hackers. Ultimately, such advances can im=
