OK I must admit: Russia is not exactly the place where laws work, but there
is nothing scary about it. And no one cares about foreigners as long as
they don't get actively involved in local politics. If, by some obscure and
extremely rare occasion, the authorities even bother finding out about any
cases of online activism worth their acknowledgement, that person won't get
a visa, that's all.
Come to Belarus, we have it much worse :D
