            no problem for the
            foreigners coming for an international conference. The only
            way someone could
            run into problems is if there would be a person under age of
            18 present on the
            conference, and then someone would file a complaint about
            him hearing something
            positive about LGBT. But since conference would be in
            English, and most Russians,
            especially those who support this law, do not know this
            language, I believe

                <p>Dear Dr Parker,</p>
                <p>Thanks for asking a question that may have been on
                  many people’s minds. I have been discussing this issue
                  with Alina Latypova, the conference chair. My
                  understanding is that St Petersburg is an
                  international city, and that it is extremely unlikely
                  that there will be any LGBT directed harassment. There
                  also appear to be high levels of support for equal
                  rights for the LGBT community in response to the
                  government’s lamentable position. Of course nobody can
                  give definitive assurances about any city, but I hope
                  that we can offer some reassurances. We have an
                  inclusivity policy that is stated on the website.
                  Anyone is welcome to write to us to continue this

                            <br>
                            The theme of this year’s conference is <b>‘The
                              Aesthetics of Computer Games’.</b> Playing
                            games yields particular kinds of playful
                            experiences or perceptions through the
                            senses, which can be studied with an
                            aesthetic focus, emphasising aísthēsis over
                            noêsis. Computer games can be regarded as
                            playful media that organise our perceptions
                            and modify our sensibilities. For this
                            conference, we welcome submissions on (but
                            not limited to) the following themes and
                            questions: <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>1. Aesthetics as aesthesis (aísthēsis).</b>
                            Is there an aesthetics or mode of experience
                            that is specific to computer games? How do
                            their visual, audio, and haptic aspects come
                            together to produce distinctive experiences?
                            How are ‘experience’ and ‘perception’
                            explored in computer games and shaped by
                            them? Can concepts such as ‘affect’,
                            ‘atmosphere’, and ‘rhythm’ be productively
                            applied to computer games? What is the role
                            of game interfaces on player experience? <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>2. Games as art?</b> What are the
                            conditions of possibility of games being
                            art? How do computer games fit into
                            established categories or conventions of
                            aesthetics, and how do they contribute to
                            new ones? Do games recognised as having a
                            claim to artistic status differ from
                            mainstream games? How do accounts of art
                            based on necessary and sufficient conditions
                            match up against anti-essentialist accounts
                            in terms of gauging the status of computer
                            games? <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>3. The aesthetics of gaming practices.</b>
                            Are games collaboratively authored? How do
                            different kinds of play, or player-game
                            conjunctions, bring about different kinds of
                            gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences?
                            How do different bodies encounter computer
                            games and what can be said about the way in
                            which gameplay experience is mediated by our
                            bodies? <br>
                            Do some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic
                            player practices have an aesthetic
                            orientation? Are computer games
                            performances? <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>4. The ethical, political, and social
                              dimensions of game aesthetics.</b> What is
                            the transformative potential of computer
                            games and how does this compare to the
                            transformative capabilities ascribed to
                            artworks? How do aesthetic issues
                            interconnect with ethical, social, and
                            political ones – what is the autonomy or
                            heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are
                            taste, sensibility, and habit acquired with
                            respect to gameplay and what are the social
