Call For Papers


*PLAY, GAMES, MENTAL HEALTH*The Young Academics Workshop at the Clash of
Realities Conference

Tuesday, November 19, 2019

*Guest Scholar:* Isabela Granic (Radboud University, GEMH lab)
*Committee:* Su-Jin Song (CGL), Michael S. Debus (ITU), Curtis Maughan
(Vanderbilt), Federico Alvarez Igarz=C3=A1bal (IGPP)

Organized by the Cologne Game Lab, TH K=C3=B6ln =E2=80=93 University of App=
lied Sciences
(Germany) in cooperation with IT University of Copenhagen (Denmark),
Vanderbilt University (USA), and the Institute for Frontier Areas of
Psychology and Mental Health (IGPP, Germany).

This year, the Young Academics Workshop will explore the connection between
mental health and the act of play, whether it is free or structured by
rules. We want to discuss claims that play and games, or a lack thereof,
can have a significant impact on our psychological well-being; the
potential of play to treat psychopathologies; and the numerous technical
and artistic ways in which play can represent or reflect a spectrum of
psychological states, among other topics.

Video games tend to be a matter of social concern, especially among parents
and educators who often pose questions like: Are kids gaming too much? How
much is too much? What consequences can excessive gaming have on an
individual=E2=80=99s development? Current claims about video game addiction=
 and
related disorders notwithstanding, research on the effects of video games
on mental health is still inconclusive. Despite this persisting gap in our
knowledge, the medium is often blamed for making players antisocial,
addicted, or depressed. At the same time, arguments for the possible
benefits of gaming are put forward with lesser frequency. This might come
as a surprise when we consider that many contemporary titles deal directly
with mental health issues, such as depression (*Depression Quest*),
grief (*That
Dragon, Cancer*), and psychosis (*Hellblade: Senua=E2=80=99s Sacrifice*).

The Young Academics Workshop=E2=80=99s aim in 2019 is to discuss mental hea=
lth and
play from a wide range of perspectives. Since video games are not an
isolated phenomenon, the workshop will frame the issue broadly=E2=80=94incl=
uding
free play, and both analog and digital games=E2=80=94while paying attention=
 to the
ways in which these activities, or an absence thereof, might impact mental
health.

We are happy to announce that Isabela Granic=E2=80=94Professor and Chair of=
 the
Developmental Psychopathology department at Radboud University (the
Netherlands) and director of the GEMH (Games for Emotion and Mental Health)
Lab=E2=80=94will be joining this year=E2=80=99s workshop. Granic=E2=80=99s =
groundbreaking work
integrates psychological research with game design to create games to treat
and study psychopathologies such as depression and anxiety. With her unique
expertise, Granic will accompany us in a day of stimulating discussion and
close the workshop with a talk.

Possible submission topics *might include*, but are *not limited to*:

- The impact of play in child and adolescent development
- Video games and addiction
- Gamification of mental health treatments
- Digital and analog games as therapy
- Representations of mental disorders in games and play
- Game design as a way to cope with mental or emotional strain

We welcome contributions from scholars from all academic fields and
disciplines (psychology, media studies, art history, philosophy,
neuroscience, play and game studies, etc.) and from game developers and
game development students (future game artists, game designers, game
programmers, and all other students learning to make games). As this is a
Young Academics Workshop, we invite all those who have recently entered the
academic world, including Bachelor, Master, and PhD students, as well as
Postdocs.

Applicants should focus on the relationship between play, games, and mental
health from the unique perspective of their home discipline.

Participants will hold 15-minute presentations followed by 15 minutes of
discussion.

Applicants should submit abstracts (no longer than 300 words) along with a
bibliography/ludography to youngacademics@clashofrealities.com

All submissions will be assessed by a peer-review committee.

*IMPORTANT DATES*
Deadline for submissions: July 31
Notification of acceptance/rejection: September 7

mics Workshop will explore the connection between mental health and the act=
 of play, whether it is free or structured by rules. We want to discuss cla=
ims that play and games, or a lack thereof, can have a significant impact o=
n our psychological well-being; the potential of play to treat psychopathol=
ogies; and the numerous technical and artistic ways in which play can repre=
sent or reflect a spectrum of psychological states, among other topics.</di=
v><div><br>Video games tend to be a matter of social concern, especially am=
ong parents and educators who often pose questions like: Are kids gaming to=
o much? How much is too much? What consequences can excessive gaming have o=
n an individual=E2=80=99s development?&nbsp;Current claims about video game=
 addiction and related disorders notwithstanding, research on the effects o=
f video games on mental health is still inconclusive. Despite this persisti=
ng gap in our knowledge, the medium is often blamed for making players anti=
social, addicted, or depressed. At the same time, arguments for the possibl=
e benefits of gaming are put forward with lesser frequency. This might come=
 as a surprise when we consider that many contemporary titles deal directly=
 with mental health issues, such as depression (<i>Depression Quest</i>), g=
rief (<i>That Dragon, Cancer</i>), and psychosis (<i>Hellblade: Senua=E2=80=
=99s Sacrifice</i>).</div><div><br>The Young Academics Workshop=E2=80=99s a=
im in 2019 is to discuss mental health and play from a wide range of perspe=
ctives. Since video games are not an isolated phenomenon, the workshop will=
 frame the issue broadly=E2=80=94including free play, and both analog and d=
igital games=E2=80=94while paying attention to the ways in which these acti=
vities, or an absence thereof, might impact mental health.</div><div><br>We=
 are happy to announce that Isabela Granic=E2=80=94Professor and Chair of t=
he Developmental Psychopathology department at Radboud University (the Neth=
erlands) and director of the GEMH (Games for Emotion and Mental Health) Lab=
=E2=80=94will be joining this year=E2=80=99s workshop. Granic=E2=80=99s gro=
undbreaking work integrates psychological research with game design to crea=
te games to treat and study psychopathologies such as depression and anxiet=
y. With her unique expertise, Granic will accompany us in a day of stimulat=
ing discussion and close the workshop with a talk.</div><div><br>Possible s=
