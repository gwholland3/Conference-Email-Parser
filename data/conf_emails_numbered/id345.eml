Dear Dr. Foaad Khosmood:

(We are re-sending this email - our earlier attempt had bounced back; the reason
for the bounce was that a mediator server had assigned 87 points for the use of
HOT words/terms/attachments that appeared in our earlier email and so wrongly
determined that that message was spam - we are sending this email with the
hope that you will receive it this time since we included the reviews as text,
instead of attachment, and also we have tried to avoid using too many HOT terms.)

You will find the reviews of the following accepted submission in this email.

ICA3949

     Specific Comment to the Authors:

     a> This is a concise paper - I very much liked it and learned from it.
     a> I recommend its acceptance without hesitation. Dr. Foaad presents in this paper
     a> six distinct English-language sentence paraphrasing techniques. He then describes
     a> the basic algorithm for each and score them on precision and recall using 50
     a> random sentences from project Tatoeba. His main objective is to use these
     a> techniques for style transformation. Quite enlightening. There is novelty in his
     a> study. I would have liked to see a more in-depth presetation in section III
     a> (on Methodology).

     b> I nominate ACCEPT for this paper. The information provided in Table 3 and
     b> Figure 3 are a little fuzzy - a more detailed explanation would help.
     b> The reference list is good and relevant (as well as being uptodate).
