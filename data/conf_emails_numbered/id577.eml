*Call for Papers for*

*II. Zip-Scene Conference on Analogue and Digital Immersive Spaces*
*Budapest, 10-12 November, 2019*
Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design
*Application deadline: 17th of June*

New digital tools provide novel opportunities for interactive digital
narratives (IDN) in mixed reality environments, performance art and
analogue immersive spaces. But does this mean that we can tell existing
stories in a better way in these environments? Or should we change our way
of thinking about how we perceive our world in order to create more
comprehensive narrative experiences? In a recent keynote (ICIDS 2018
conference) Janet H. Murray =E2=80=93 author of the groundbreaking volume H=
amlet on
Holodeck =E2=80=93 the Future of Narrative in Cyberspace (1997/2016), remin=
ds us
that =E2=80=9Ca kaleidoscopic habit of thinking=E2=80=9D can help us =E2=80=

integrated transformational future=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Copen up the possib=
ility of
expanding our understanding of the world and our cognitive capacity=E2=80=
=9D
(Murray, 2018:17). To better grasp the complexity of the world, it is
important to enhance emerging artistic practices in order to create
opportunities for critical reflection while acknowledging the changed
relationship between creators and audiences turned
participants/prosumers/experiencers.

This conference aims to investigate whether XR/extended reality (VR/AR/MR)
works will acquire a status comparable to film, performing arts and video
games in the near future. On this basis, we are looking forward to papers
that address narrative experiences enabled by XR and especially VR
technologies. Papers should address either one or several of the following
questions:

What kind of narratives can be used to create possibility spaces in such
immersive productions?
How much engagement with and control over the narrative path is desirable
for the audience turned participants?
What design strategies can guide these participatory experiences: for
example, live performers, orchestrators, and set designers using the
sensorium of New Horror (see Ndalianis, 2012) or somaesthetic design
concepts (see H=C3=B6=C3=B6k, 2018) to create novel forms of immersion in t=
hese
environments?
What kind of design strategies can we use to provide a satisfying level of
agency to participant audiences and provide opportunities for co-creation?
What is the current status of interactive digital narrative experiences,
have they completed their evolution from being media of attraction (see
Rouse, 2016) or there is still a long way for them to go in order to find
the right direction?
What can we learn from a comparison of site-specific live arts productions
with those of VR projects?
How can we explore free-form play and rule-based gaming as different types
of performances within mixed-reality theatre and immersive theatre?

In addition, we want to challenge established storytelling strategies and
instead more thoroughly analyze ways of creating engaging experiences:

What kind of principles of video game design do XR productions make use of
(e.g. puzzle dependency charts and plot-shaped level design - see Short,
2019)?
What design strategies createed the experience of full immersivity and
presence for their users-turned-participants (see 2018/4 issue of the
journal of Performance Arts and Digital Media).

Further developing Murray=E2=80=99s perspective on the =E2=80=98kaleidoscop=
ic habit=E2=80=99, we
expect presentations that engage with the practice of transdisciplinary
creators to adapt video game mechanics, various sensorium settings and
interactive narrative design strategies in order to create fully immersive
environments. Possible analyzes can be on topics such as overall aesthetics
authorial affordances, design principles and conventions (Koenitz et al,
2018) as well as the audience=E2=80=99s experience (especially engagement a=
nd
empowering mechanisms) and, last but not least, as interactive narratives.
Some possible perspectives include Murray=E2=80=99s affordances and aesthet=
ic
qualities of the digital medium, Bogost=E2=80=99s procedural rhetoric, Kwas=
tek=E2=80=99s
=E2=80=9Caesthetics of interactivity=E2=80=9D, somaesthetic design concepts=
 (H=C3=B6=C3=B6k), guiding
strategies based on New Horror=E2=80=99s sensorium (Ndalianis, 2012) the
trajectories offered by them (based on Benford-Giannachi=E2=80=99s concept)=
 and
interactive narrative systems (Koenitz, 2015).

*Conference themes:*
Interactive storytelling methods
Interactive videos
Video games
Location-based technology (with augmented reality)
Virtual reality experiences&movies
Augmented reality in interactive storytelling
Games-based performing arts practices using new technology tools
Interactive Museum
Immersive environments (media archeology and phenomenological approach)
Transmedia storytelling

Proposals may be for a paper or a panel and should be related to at least
one of the conference themes. *Deadline for submitting the proposals is
June 17, 2019. Please send us your abstract (max 350 words) and a short bio
(max. 300 words) to the address: zipscene@mome.hu <zipscene@mome.hu> and
please in CC: bakk@mome.hu <bakk@mome.hu>. The papers will be reviewed by
the conference committee. If your proposal will be accepted you will be
given 20 minutes for your presentation.*


*Registration fee: EUR 50*
The organizers cannot cover travel, accommodation and lodging costs. Upon
request we can provide you invitation letter.


*For Whom*
The conference addresses scientific researchers, game professionals,
programmers, artists, scholars and professionals from the field of
performing arts, game studies, interactive storytellers, experience
designers, narrative designers, VR-professionals and philosophers concerned
with the conference topics. The conference aims to bring together emerging
scholars, professionals and creators in order to create a joint platform

l tools provide novel opportunities for interactive digital narratives (IDN=
) in mixed reality environments, performance art and analogue immersive spa=
ces. But does this mean that we can tell existing stories in a better way i=
n these environments? Or should we change our way of thinking about how we =
perceive our world in order to create more comprehensive narrative experien=
ces? In a recent keynote (ICIDS 2018 conference) Janet H. Murray =E2=80=93 =
author of the groundbreaking volume Hamlet on Holodeck =E2=80=93 the Future=
 of Narrative in Cyberspace (1997/2016), reminds us that =E2=80=9Ca kaleido=
scopic habit of thinking=E2=80=9D can help us =E2=80=9Cenvision a more inte=
grated transformational future=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Copen up the possibilit=
y of expanding our understanding of the world and our cognitive capacity=E2=
=80=9D (Murray, 2018:17). To better grasp the complexity of the world, it i=
s important to enhance emerging artistic practices in order to create oppor=
tunities for critical reflection while acknowledging the changed relationsh=
ip between creators and audiences turned participants/prosumers/experiencer=
s.<br><br>This conference aims to investigate whether XR/extended reality (=
VR/AR/MR) works will acquire a status comparable to film, performing arts a=
nd video games in the near future. On this basis, we are looking forward to=
 papers that address narrative experiences enabled by XR and especially VR =
technologies. Papers should address either one or several of the following =
questions:<br><br>What kind of narratives can be used to create possibility=
 spaces in such immersive productions?<br>How much engagement with and cont=
rol over the narrative path is desirable for the audience turned participan=
ts?<br>What design strategies can guide these participatory experiences: fo=
r example, live performers, orchestrators, and set designers using the sens=
orium of New Horror (see Ndalianis, 2012) or somaesthetic design concepts (=
see H=C3=B6=C3=B6k, 2018) to create novel forms of immersion in these envir=
onments?<br>What kind of design strategies can we use to provide a satisfyi=
ng level of agency to participant audiences and provide opportunities for c=
o-creation?<br>What is the current status of interactive digital narrative =
experiences, have they completed their evolution from being media of attrac=
tion (see Rouse, 2016) or there is still a long way for them to go in order=
 to find the right direction?<br>What can we learn from a comparison of sit=
e-specific live arts productions with those of VR projects?<br>How can we e=
xplore free-form play and rule-based gaming as different types of performan=
ces within mixed-reality theatre and immersive theatre?<br><br>In addition,=
 we want to challenge established storytelling strategies and instead more =
thoroughly analyze ways of creating engaging experiences:<br><br>What kind =
of principles of video game design do XR productions make use of (e.g. puzz=
le dependency charts and plot-shaped level design - see Short, 2019)?<br>Wh=
at design strategies createed the experience of full immersivity and presen=
ce for their users-turned-participants (see 2018/4 issue of the journal of =
Performance Arts and Digital Media).<br><br>Further developing Murray=E2=80=
=99s perspective on the =E2=80=98kaleidoscopic habit=E2=80=99, we expect pr=
esentations that engage with the practice of transdisciplinary creators to =
adapt video game mechanics, various sensorium settings and interactive narr=
ative design strategies in order to create fully immersive environments. Po=
ssible analyzes can be on topics such as overall aesthetics authorial affor=
dances, design principles and conventions (Koenitz et al, 2018) as well as =
the audience=E2=80=99s experience (especially engagement and empowering mec=
hanisms) and, last but not least, as interactive narratives. Some possible =
