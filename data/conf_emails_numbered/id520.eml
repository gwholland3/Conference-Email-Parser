n accurate reflection of the situation given how trans, genderqueer, and non=
binary folks are most frequently targeted for harassment, assault, and legis=

ilable for providing safe presentation options to queer and particularly tra=
ns game studies scholars if the conference is to continue in St. Petersburg,=
 but it=E2=80=99s not an ideal or particularly inclusive solution. I don=E2=80=
=99t have an easy answer to this because there isn=E2=80=99t one, but it see=
ms to me that the conference has to decide between safety and support for LG=
BTQ game scholars and the importance of holding the conference in different l=
ocations that allow more people to participate. Whatever is decided here and=
 moving forward, I think it=E2=80=99s important that the safety of queer fol=
ks not be sacrificed in the name of holding a conference in more locations, a=
nd ideally finding conference locations that accomplish both. I do hope that=
 the St. Petersburg conference will provide opportunities to present for fol=
ks who aren=E2=80=99t able to make other international conferences and parti=
cularly local LGBTQ folks, though it seems that they too might have to be ca=
reful about what they present at the conference.
