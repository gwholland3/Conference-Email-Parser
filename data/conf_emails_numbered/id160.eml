                  POSTERS Due for publication. Papers submitted and accepted in
                  response to this announcement will be published in the Final
                  Edition of the proceedings which will go to press soon after
                  the conference; they will also be indexed in science citation
                  index databases. The Final Edition of the proceedings will be
                  identical to the Preliminary Edition except for the addition
                  of the accepted LATE BREAKING PAPERS, POSITION PAPERS,
                  ABSTRACTS/POSTERS at the end of the books. The conference
                  would make the necessary arrangements to ship the printed
                  proceedings/books to such authors.


SUBMISSION OF LATE BREAKING PAPERS, POSITION PAPERS, ABSTRACTS/POSTERS:

In response to this announcement, authors are given the opportunity to
submit their papers for evaluation in one of the following three paper
categories:

   1. LATE BREAKING PAPERS: describe late-breaking/recent developments in
      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the
      following on the first page of your submission "name of conference:
      LATE BREAKING PAPER". If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-
      Ready paper will be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and
      the author will be given the opportunity to present the paper in a
      formal session.

   2. POSITION PAPERS: enable discussions on emerging topics without the
      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,
      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward
      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.
      The maximum number of pages is 5. Please write the following on the
      first page of your submission "name of conference: POSITION PAPER".
      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be
      limited to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be
      given the opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.

   3. ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPERS: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD
      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please
      write the following on the first page of your submission "name of
      conference: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER". If accepted, The length of the
      final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited to 2 (two-column IEEE
      style) pages and the author will be given the opportunity to
      present the paper in a discussion/poster session.

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them
to the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must
be uploaded by the due date (see IMPORTANT DATES) and must be in either
MS doc or pdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable
(later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a
particular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for
publication; these formatting instructions appear at:
http://world-comp.org  and they conform to the two-column IEEE style
format). Papers must not have been previously published or currently
submitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should
include: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email
address for each author as well as a maximum of 5 topical keywords that
would best represent the content of the paper. The first page should also
identify the name of the Contact/Corresponding author together with
his/her professional email address. A 100 to 150-word abstract should
appear on the first page. Authors are to conform to the common CODE OF
ETHICS FOR AUTHORS (The document for the Code of Ethics is available on
the submission web site.)

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of
contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program
committee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);
often, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers
whose authors include a member of the conference program committee will
be evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical
papers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in
science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each
published paper. All proceedings are also approved for inclusion into
EBSCO ( www.ebsco.com ), one of the largest subject index systems. The
titles of proceedings of the federated congress have been indexed into
the ACM Digital Library ( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes
bibliographic citations from major publishers in computing.

In addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple
books in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in
Computer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer
publishers (Transactions of Computational Science and Computational
Intelligence). After the conference (the process may take 12 to 18
months), a significant number of authors of accepted papers of our
congress, will be given the opportunity to submit the extended version
of their papers for publication consideration in these books. We
anticipate having between 10 and 20 books a year in each of these
book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to
Elsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes:
Scopus, www.info.scopus.com ; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village,
www.ei.org ; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com ; and others). For a recent
and a very small subset of the books (and journal special issues) that
have been published based on the extended versions of many of our
congress papers, see the link below:

http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp15/ws/books_journals 

Note that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement,
will have their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the
Final Edition of the conference proceedings which will go to press
soon after the conference (the conference would then make the necessary
arrangements to ship the printed proceedings/books to such authors).
The Final Edition of the conference proceedings will be identical to
earlier edition except for a number of sections/chapters appended to
the proceedings/book.

An important mission of The Congress is "Providing a unique platform for
a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities
(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also
attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that
have research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to
achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer
science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also
encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;
i.e., facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across
sub-disciplines.  138939
