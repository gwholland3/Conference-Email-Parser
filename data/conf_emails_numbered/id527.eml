Hello everyone.


The official law behind LGBT discrimination in Russia is so-called "Russian
gay propaganda Law" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_gay_propaganda_la=
w It
prohibits spreading of the information about LGBT among minors. And while
it is absolutely disgusting, from the practical point of view this law
poses no problem for the foreigners coming for an international conference.
The only way someone could run into problems is if there would be a person
under age of 18 present on the conference, and then someone would file a
complaint about him hearing something positive about LGBT. But since
conference would be in English, and most Russians, especially those who
support this law, do not know this language, I believe that it would be
fine.

will be any LGBT directed harassment. There also appear to be high levels o=
f support for equal rights for the LGBT community in response to the govern=
ment=E2=80=99s lamentable position. Of course nobody can give definitive as=
surances about any city, but I hope that we can offer some reassurances. We=
