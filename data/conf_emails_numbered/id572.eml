Just a quick reminder that the extended deadline for The Workshop on
User Experience of Artificial Intelligence in Games is on Friday May
3rd! See below for CFP and links.

Call for Papers to the 2019 Workshop on User Experience of Artificial
Intelligence in Games @ FDG

How do players experience Artificial Intelligence (AI) in games? How do
they feel about the AI, and how is what the AI does communicated to the
player? Is there interaction with the AI, and if so, who takes the lead?
Is this a social experience, a believable one? Is the AI creative, or at
least perceived as such? And finally, is the AI making the game
experience better?
AIs fill many roles in games, from companions to antagonists, from
storytellers to architects and game testers. With all the recent focus
and technical advances in AI this is likely to increase, and the recent
popularity of artificial intelligence is moving AIs to the foreground of
games. This raises many questions — and in this workshop, we want to
look at those surrounding the player's user experience with artificial
intelligence in its many forms.

The 2019 Workshop on User Experience and Artificial Intelligence
encompasses the intersection between UX and AI as it manifests in games.
We wish to act as a point of interaction between researchers specialized
within these fields, in the hope that this will help facilitate research
that allows for the creation of more interesting and robust AI-based
game experiences.
This workshop aims to build a community centered on this by putting
forward demonstrations of work in the integration of these two areas, as
well as models and theories that can be used to create understanding
where the areas intersect. We especially welcome demonstrations of work
in progress or work showcasing new ideas. We are interested in realized
prototypes, demons and applications — especially designed created to
explore hypotheses. We are also open to philosophical and
humanities-based approaches and provocative ideas.

The workshop is co-located and organized with the 2019 Foundations of
Digital Games (FDG) conference in San Luis Obispo, California, USA. The
exact workshop date is TBD, but will take place sometime during the
conference (August 26-30, 2019).

Topics
Topics include, but are not limited to:
the believability and presentation of non-player characters
the UX created by procedurally generated content
the narratives woven by director AIs
trade-offs between autonomy and control over storylines, dialogue, and
similar
perception and acceptance of game design assistance tools
the presentation of AI in game design
the perception of AI in games
user-centric examinations of the various technologies that are used to
construct these in-game functions
of particular interest are studies on how we create interesting game
experiences using AI, and how these are interpreted by players

Submission guidelines
We will accept submissions for the following:
Papers
Demos
Interesting artifacts

The workshop will accept submissions in the form of papers and
demos/artifacts. Submissions will be subject to double-blind peer
review. Each submission will receive feedback from at least two
reviewers, as well as a meta-review. Authors of accepted submissions
will be invited to give an oral presentation of their submission. We are
especially interested in seeing work in progress or discussions of open
issues within the field.

Submissions must use the ACM template. Papers must be 5-8 pages long,
excluding references. Demo/artifact submissions can be up to 2 pages
long and must containing a link where the demo/artifact can be downloaded.
Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library along with
the conference proceedings of FDG 2019.

Submission instructions
All submissions should be in the PDF format, use the ACM Master
Template, and be submitted through EasyChair.
