Manuscript Due Date Extended to March 1, 2014, for the Special Issue on
Energy-Aware Resource Management and Scheduling (EARMS) in the Elsevier
journal Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems (SUSCOM).

CALL FOR PAPERS - Special Issue of Sustainable Computing: Informatics and
Systems (SUSCOM) on Energy-Aware Resource Management and Scheduling (EARMS).

Scope: The growing scale of High Performance Computing (HPC) systems and
data centers has made issues related to power consumption, air conditioning,
and cooling infrastructures critical concerns in terms of efficiency,
operational cost, reliability, energy conservation, and environmental impact.
High-end HPC systems today consume several megawatts of power, enough to
power small towns, and are, in fact, soon approaching the limits of the
power available to them. Furthermore, the costs of powering these HPC systems
runs into millions of dollars per year, and are increasing as these systems
target sustained petascale and plan for exascale. Adding to the concerns
due to power and cooling requirements and associated costs, empirical data
show that every 10 degree Celsius increase in temperature results in a
doubling of the system failure rate, which reduces the reliability of these
expensive systems. At the same time, the increasing proliferation of
virtualization technologies and the consolidation of computing platforms for
data- and compute-intensive applications are providing new opportunities to
use advanced scheduling and resource management techniques for higher
utilization and energy savings. As a result, resource management policies
that consider the tradeoffs between energy usage and performance, throughput,
and other QoS requirements, have become important research challenges that
must be addressed.
In this special issue, we seek original work focused on addressing new
research and development challenges, consisting of developing new scheduling
techniques and advanced resource management solutions in green computing
for HPC systems.

Specific topics include, but not limited to, the following:
*              Energy-aware task scheduling heuristics
*              Energy-aware resource management infrastructures
*              Thermal-aware task scheduling heuristics
*              Thermal-aware resource management infrastructures
*              Energy and thermal-aware scheduling for fault-tolerance
*              Enhanced performance, energy, and thermal models for energy-
                 aware schedulers
*              Resource management in power/energy constrained systems
*              Energy efficiency and virtualization
*              Energy, performance, quality of service, and other resource
              tradeoffs
*              Energy-aware scheduling for heterogeneous systems
*              Energy-aware scheduling for parallel and distributed systems
*              Energy-efficient scheduling of hardware accelerators (FPGAs,
              GPUs, etc.)
*              Energy-aware scheduling for different computing paradigms:
              cluster, grid, cloud, and datacenters

Submission Details:
General information for submitting papers to SUSCOM can be found at
http://ees.elsevier.com/suscom/ (please note the "Guide for Authors" link).
Submissions to this Special Issue (SI) should be made using Elsevier's
editorial system at the journal website
(http://ees.elsevier.com/suscom/ , under the "submit paper" link). Please
make sure to select the "SI: En. Aware Sched." option for the type of the
paper during the submission process. All submissions must be original and
may not be under review. A submission based on one or more papers that
appeared elsewhere has to include major value-added extensions over what
appeared previously (at least 30% new conceptual material). Authors are
requested to attach to the submitted paper such earlier articles and a
summary document explaining the enhancements made in the journal version.
All submitted papers will be peer reviewed using the normal standards of
SUSCOM. By submitting a paper to this special issue, the authors agree to
review at least one paper within the time frame of the SI.
