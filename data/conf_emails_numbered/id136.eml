INTRODUCTION:

   We anticipate having between 1,000 and 2,000 participants in the
   Congress. The congress includes 20 major tracks

   technical, research, and panel sessions as well as a number of
   keynote lectures and tutorials; all will be held simultaneously,
   same location and dates: July 29 - August 1, 2019. Last year,
   the Congress had attracted speakers/authors and participants
   affiliated with over 169 different universities (including many
   from the top 50 ranked institutions), major IT corporations
   (including: Microsoft, Google, Apple, SAP, Facebook, Oracle, Amazon,
   Yahoo, Samsung, IBM, Ebay, GE, Siemens, Philips, Ericsson, BAE
   Systems, Hitachi, NTT, ...), major corporations (including: Exxon
   Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, PetroChina, GlaxoSmithKline,

   issues. Last year, 55% of attendees were from academia, 24% from
   industry; 20% from government and funding agencies; and 1% unknown.
   About half of the attendees were from outside USA; from 72 nations.
   The event is among the top five largest international annual gathering
   of researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
   computing. To get a feeling about the conferences' atmosphere, see
