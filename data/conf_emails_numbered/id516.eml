ng from a distance often involves just giving the presentation and being in=
volved with one panel and then leaving, which means missing out on a lot of=
 the discussion and networking that makes conferencing valuable in the firs=
t place. It might be the best option available for providing safe presentat=
ion options to queer and particularly trans game studies scholars if the co=
nference is to continue in St. Petersburg, but it=E2=80=99s not an ideal or=
 particularly inclusive solution. I don=E2=80=99t have an easy answer to th=
is because there isn=E2=80=99t one, but it seems to me that the conference =
has to decide between safety and support for LGBTQ game scholars and the im=
portance of holding the conference in different locations that allow more p=
eople to participate. Whatever is decided here and moving forward, I think =
it=E2=80=99s important that the safety of queer folks not be sacrificed in =
the name of holding a conference in more locations, and ideally finding con=
ference locations that accomplish both. I do hope that the St. Petersburg c=
