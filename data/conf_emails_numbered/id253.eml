SUBMISSION OF LATE BREAKING PAPERS, POSITION PAPERS, ABSTRACTS/POSTERS:

In response to this announcement, authors are given the opportunity to submit
their papers for evaluation in one of the following three categories:

   1. Late Breaking Papers: describe late-breaking/recent developments in
      the field. The maximum number of pages is 7. Please write the following
      on the first page of your submission "ICAI: LATE BREAKING PAPER".
      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited
      to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the
      opportunity to present the paper in a formal session.

   2. Position Papers: enable discussions on emerging topics without the
      experimentation normally present in an academic paper. Commonly,
      such papers will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward
      with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.
      The maximum number of pages is 4. Please write the following on the
      first page of your submission "ICAI: POSITION PAPER".
      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited
      to 4 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the
      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.

   3. Abstract/Poster Papers: describe research roadmaps (similar to PhD
      plan or PhD prospectus). The maximum number of pages is 2. Please
      write the following on the first page of your submission
      "ICAI: ABSTRACT/POSTER PAPER".
      If accepted, The length of the final/Camera-Ready paper will be limited
      to 2 (two-column IEEE style) pages and the author will be given the
      opportunity to present the paper in a discussion/poster session.

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers (see above for paper
categories) by uploading them to the evaluation web site at:
http://world-comp.org .
Submissions must be uploaded by June 4, 2014 and must be in either MS doc or
pdf formats. All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the
authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting
format to prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have
been previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.
The first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,
affiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The first
page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5
topical keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for originality,
significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of contradictory
recommendations, a member of the conference program committee would be
charged to make the final decision (accept/reject); often, this would involve
seeking help from additional referees. Papers whose authors include a member
of the conference program committee will be evaluated using the double-blinded
review process. (Papers deemed to be philosophical, essay type, or about
controversial topics/applications will not be refereed but may be considered
for discussion/panels/presentation).

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and will
also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in science
citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each published
paper. Science citation databases include: relevant Elsevier indexing
products (SCI Elsevier products include, among others: Scopus,
www.info.scopus.com; Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE,
www.info.embase.com; and others); Inspec / IET / The Institute for
Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for Scientific Research,
CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog,
EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, and STN International); and others.

Note that authors who submit papers in response to this announcement, will
have their papers evaluated for publication consideration in the Final Edition
of the conference proceedings which will go to press soon after the conference
(the conference would then make the necessary arrangements to ship the printed
proceedings/books to such authors). The Final Edition of the conference
proceedings will be identical to earlier edition except for a number of
sections/chapters appended to the proceedings/book.

GENERAL INFORMATION:

ICAI is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,
professionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster
working relationships and gain access to the latest research results. It is
being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of other research
conferences; namely, The 2014 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer
Engineering, and Applied Computing. The Congress is among the top five largest
annual gathering of researchers in computer science, computer engineering and
applied computing. We anticipate to have attendees from about 85

An important mission of The Congress is "Providing a unique platform for
a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities
(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also
attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that
have research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to
achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer
science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also
encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;
ie, facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across
sub-disciplines.

TUTORIALS:

All tutorials are free to conference registrants, the list of tutorials
