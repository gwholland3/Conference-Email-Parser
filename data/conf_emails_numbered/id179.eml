May 10, 2014:      Notification of acceptance (+/- two days)
May 24, 2014:      Final papers + Copyright + Registration
July 21-24, 2014:  The 2014 International Conference on Frontiers in
                   Education: Computer Science and Computer Engineering
                   (FECS'14)


SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them
to the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must
be uploaded by April 19, 2014 and must be in either MS doc or pdf
formats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables, and references -
single space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable typesetting formats
are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to
follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for
publication.) Papers must not have been previously published or currently
submitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should
include: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email
address for each author. The first page should also identify the name of
the Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best
represent the content of the paper. The name of the conference that the
paper is being submitted for consideration (i.e., FECS) must also be
stated on the first page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word
abstract. The length of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will
be limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of
contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program
committee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);
often, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers
whose authors include a member of the conference program committee will
be evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical
papers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).

The FECS'14 proceedings will be published in printed conference books
(ISBN) and will also be made available online. The printed proceedings/
books will be available for distribution on site at the conference. The
proceedings will be indexed in science citation databases that track
citation frequency/data for each published paper. Science citation
databases include: Inspec / IET / The Institute for Engineering &
Technology; The French National Center for Scientific Research, CNRS,
INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST, Datastar, Dialog, EBSCO,
OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, & STN International); and others. Though,
there is no guarantee that the proceedings will also be included in
SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier indexings; in the past, many of the proceedings
of the federated congress that FECS is part of were included in these
databases. Therefore, we will also be sending the proceedings for
indexing procedures to SCI EI Compendex/Elsevier.

In addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple
books in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in
Computer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer publishers
(Transactions of Computational Science and Computational Intelligence).
After the conference (the whole process takes 12 months), a significant
number of authors of accepted papers of FECS, will be given the
opportunity to submit the extended version of their papers for publication
consideration in these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books
a year in each of these book series projects. Each book in each series
will be subject to Elsevier and Springer science indexing products (which
includes: Scopus, www.info.scopus.com; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village,
www.ei.org; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com; and others). See below for recent
examples of books/journals based on extended versions of accepted papers
of the federated congress that FECS is part of:

SUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:

Poster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same
instructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except
for the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author
should state that "This paper is being submitted as a poster". Poster
papers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the
accepted paper wishes to do so.


GENERAL INFORMATION:

FECS is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars,
professionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster
working relationships and gain access to the latest research results. It is
being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of other research

An important mission of The Congress is "Providing a unique platform for
a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities
(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also
attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that
have research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to
achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer
science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also
encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;
ie, facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across
sub-disciplines. 138939

MEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:

As of December 14, 2013, papers published in the conference proceedings
that have been held as part of the federated Congress, have received over
27,500 citations (includes about 3,300 self-citations). Citation data
obtained from http://academic.research.microsoft.com/ . The citation data
does not even include more than 15,000 other citations to papers in tracks
whose first offerings were initiated by this joint congress.
