INDEXING:
The proceedings/books of this congress have been evaluated for inclusion
into science citation index / SCI databases. We are happy to report that
so far, the evaluation board of science citation index databases have
APPROVED the indexing, integrating, and inclusion of the following
conference tracks into relevant Elsevier indexing databases (Elsevier
indexing databases include, among others: Scopus, www.info.scopus.com;
SCI Compendex, Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com;
and others): BIOCOMP, DMIN, ERSA, GCA, ICAI, ICOMP, ICWN, IKE, IPCV, PDPTA,
and SAM; please see below for the full name of each of these conferences.
In addition, all proceedings will be indexed by a number of other science
citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each paper.


INVITATION:
You are invited to submit a full paper for consideration. All accepted
papers will be published in printed conference books/proceedings (ISBN)
and will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed
in science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for
each paper. Like prior years, extended versions of selected papers
(about 35%) will appear in journals and edited research books (publishers
include: Springer, Elsevier, BMC, and others). See the following links
for a small subset of the publications based on this Congress:

http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC2709251/
http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC2999338/

In addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with
Elsevier publishers (Transactions on Computer Science and Applied Computing)
and another with Springer publishers (Transactions of Computational Science
and Computational Intelligence). After the conference, a significant number
of authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the opportunity
to submit the extended version of their papers for publication consideration
in these books. The web sites for the two book series will be made available
after the logistics are finalized between our committee and the publishers
(both book series projects have been approved.) We anticipate having between
10 to 20 books a year in each of these book series projects. Each book in
each series will be subject to Elsevier and Springer science indexing
products (which includes: Scopus, Ei village, SCI, ...). 138939

The Congress is composed of a number of tracks (joint-conferences,
tutorials, sessions, workshops, poster and panel discussions); all will
be held simultaneously, same location and dates: July 22-25, 2013. All
tutorials are free to registered conference attendees - for a partial list
of approved tutorials, see:
http://www.worldacademyofscience.org/worldcomp13/ws/tutorials 
For the complete list of joint conferences, see below.


IMPORTANT DATES - EXTENDED:

April 20, 2013:    Submission of full/regular papers (about 7 pages)
May 11, 2013:      Notification of acceptance (+/- two days)*
May 25, 2013:      Final papers + Copyright + Registration
July 22-25, 2013:  The 2013 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer
                   Engineering, and Applied Computing
                   (including all its affiliated joint-conferences).

*Authors who submitted their papers early, will receive their papers'
status report (notification) much sooner than May 11, 2013.


MEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:

As of March 14, 2013, papers published in the conference proceedings that
are currently being held as part of this congress, have received 27,591
citations (includes 3,342 self-citations). Citation data obtained from
http://academic.research.microsoft.com/ .


SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading them
to the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org . Submissions must
be uploaded by April 20, 2013 and must be in either MS doc or pdf
formats (about 7 pages including all figures, tables, and references -
single space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable typesetting formats
are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to
follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their final papers for
publication.) Papers must not have been previously published or currently
submitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the paper should
include: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and email
address for each author. The first page should also identify the name of
the Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best
represent the content of the paper. The name of the conference that the
paper is being submitted for consideration must also be stated on the
first page of the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word abstract. The length
of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to 7
(two-column IEEE style) pages.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of
contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program
committee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);
often, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers
whose authors include a member of the conference program committee will
be evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Papers deemed
to be philosophical, essay type, or about controversial topics/applications
will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels/presentation).

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in
science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each
published paper. Science citation databases include: Inspec / IET / The
Institute for Engineering & Technology; The French National Center for
Scientific Research, CNRS, INIST databases, PASCAL (accessable from INIST,
Datastar, Dialog, EBSCO, OVID, Questel.Orbit, Qwam, & STN International);
and others. The proceedings/books of this congress have been evaluated for
inclusion into major science citation index databases. We are happy to report
that so far, the evaluation board of science citation index databases have
APPROVED the indexing, integrating, and inclusion of the following
conference tracks into relevant Elsevier indexing databases (Elsevier
indexing databases include, among others: Scopus, www.info.scopus.com;
SCI Compendex, Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com;
and others): BIOCOMP, DMIN, ERSA, GCA, ICAI, ICOMP, ICWN, IKE, IPCV, PDPTA,
and SAM; please see above for the full name of each of these conferences.

In addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series; one with

of authors of accepted papers of our congress, will be given the opportunity
to submit the extended version of their papers for publication consideration
in these books. We anticipate having between 10 to 20 books a year in each
of these book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to
Elsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes: Scopus,
www.info.scopus.com; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village, www.ei.org; EMBASE,
www.info.embase.com; and others).

SUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:

Poster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same
instructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except
for the submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author
should state that "This paper is being submitted as a poster". Poster
papers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the
accepted paper wishes to do so.

An important mission of The Congress is "Providing a unique platform for
a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers,
developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted
effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities
(such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also
attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that
have research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to
achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated
research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model
facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of
computer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The
Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary
research initiatives; ie, facilitating increased opportunities for
cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.
