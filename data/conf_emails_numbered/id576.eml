CALL =46OR PAPERS
Teaching Games:Pedagogical Approaches DiGRA 2019 Pre-Conference Workshop =
(TGPA:DiGRA2019)

Context of Teaching Games
Game studies, art, design, narrative, development, and game research meth=
od courses are proliferating across colleges and universities. Some class=
es are organized into formal game design programs while others are not. T=
hey can be offered in a wide range of departments and disciplines, includ=
ing media studies, communications, computer science, sociology, English, =
education, political science, art, and many others. The primary goal of s=
uch courses is varied: to teach game design skills, game writing, product=
ion, development, critical analysis skills, as well as the history and co=
ntext of digital games. This workshop is for instructors in higher educat=
ion of all such courses to discuss their approaches, troubleshoot issues,=
 as well as identify best practices for the course and assignment design.=

The workshop is co-located and organized with the 2019 DiGRA 2019 confere=
nce in Kyoto, Japan, and will take place on August 6th, 2019. It builds o=
n successful past versions of the workshop run at both DiGRA and =46DG in=
 2014 and 2015, as well as on a later workshop on transgressive teaching =
strategies in game studies at NDigra in 2018 and HEVGA Game Educators=E2=80=
=99 Summits and symposia held in 2017 and 2018. The aim of this iteration=
 is threefold: to broaden the scope of teaching about games more generall=
y, to build a community around pedagogy and to generate scholarship that =
will result in a peer-reviewed publication.

Objectives and Outcomes
The aim of the workshop is to benefit pedagogy about games by discussing =
current issues and potential future directions in games teaching as well =
as to provide a forum for sharing and critiquing pedagogical practices. T=
he latter will be especially valuable for scholars who are among the only=
 faculty at their institution teaching games.
The workshop will be conducted in two parts: The morning session will be =
dedicated to paper presentations and discussions. The post-lunch session =
will be organized as work sessions, where groups discuss particular topic=
s (self-organized by interests).

*** Topics ***
The workshop invites papers about teaching games in higher education. The=
 following list suggests topics, but other topics relevant to pedagogical=
 approaches in teaching games are welcome.
=E2=97=8F Pedagogical methods to teaching games
=E2=97=8F Integrating games into a pre-existing curriculum
=E2=97=8F Case studies=E2=80=94teaching specific topics or areas
=E2=97=8F Bridging theory and practice through the curriculum
=E2=97=8F Creating new teaching resources and tools
=E2=97=8F Teaching students to study players
=E2=97=8F Teaching game research methods
=E2=97=8F Industry partnerships
=E2=97=8F Working with diverse groups of students and multi-disciplinary =
faculty
=E2=97=8F Logistical challenges of teaching games (access to games, prese=
rvation, and fair use)

*** Submission guidelines ***
We will accept submissions for short papers between 1000 and 3000 words i=
n length (excluding references). Submissions will be subject to double-bl=
ind peer review. Each submission will receive feedback from at least two =
reviewers. Authors of accepted submissions will be invited to give an ora=
l presentation of their submission. Submissions must use the provided MS =
Word template or the LaTeX template for the workshop (both templates are =
available at hevga.org/digracfp - in case the page is down, see links bel=
ow).

All submissions should be in the PD=46 format and be submitted through Ea=
syChair. Accepted papers will be made available online at the workshop we=
bpage.

A special issue of the ToDiGRA Journal (published by ETC Press at Carnegi=
e Mellon) is a planned outcome of the workshop. Selected workshop papers =
will be invited to submit a journal article version for inclusion in a sp=
ecial issue of the ToDiGRA Journal. Publication in the special issue will=
 require passing a second round of peer reviews.

<div>CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
Teaching Games:Pedagogical Approaches DiGRA 2019 Pre-Conference Workshop (T=
GPA:DiGRA2019)<br>
<br>
Context of Teaching Games<br>
Game studies, art, design, narrative, development, and game research method=
 courses are proliferating across colleges and universities. Some classes a=
re organized into formal game design programs while others are not. They ca=
n be offered in a wide range of departments and disciplines, including medi=
a studies, communications, computer science, sociology, English, education,=
 political science, art, and many others. The primary goal of such courses =
is varied: to teach game design skills, game writing, production, developme=
nt, critical analysis skills, as well as the history and context of digital=
 games. This workshop is for instructors in higher education of all such co=
urses to discuss their approaches, troubleshoot issues, as well as identify=
 best practices for the course and assignment design.<br>
The workshop is co-located and organized with the 2019 DiGRA 2019 conferenc=
e in Kyoto, Japan, and will take place on August 6th, 2019. It builds on su=
ccessful past versions of the workshop run at both DiGRA and FDG in 2014 an=
d 2015, as well as on a later workshop on transgressive teaching strategies=
 in game studies at NDigra in 2018 and HEVGA Game Educators=E2=80=99 Summit=
s and symposia held in 2017 and 2018. The aim of this iteration is threefol=
d: to broaden the scope of teaching about games more generally, to build a =
community around pedagogy and to generate scholarship that will result in a=
 peer-reviewed publication.<br>
<br>
Objectives and Outcomes<br>
The aim of the workshop is to benefit pedagogy about games by discussing cu=
rrent issues and potential future directions in games teaching as well as t=
o provide a forum for sharing and critiquing pedagogical practices. The lat=
ter will be especially valuable for scholars who are among the only faculty=
 at their institution teaching games.<br>
The workshop will be conducted in two parts: The morning session will be de=
dicated to paper presentations and discussions. The post-lunch session will=
 be organized as work sessions, where groups discuss particular topics (sel=
f-organized by interests).<br>
<br>
