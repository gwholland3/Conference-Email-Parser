Dear Speakers and Authors of ICAI'12:

This email is being sent to all authors, speakers, and participants who
registered for the following conference:

-> The 2012 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence
   (ICAI'12: July 16-19, 2012, USA)

Please find appended to this email, the conference schedule for the above
conference (the schedule DOES NOT include the papers/talks whose speakers
have already informed us that they will not be able to attend to present
their paper). A typeset (nicely formatted) version will soon appear at:
http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/

Please note the followings (and also requests for help):

-> If you are absolutely SURE that you will be attending the conference and
   would like to offer your help by chairing/moderating one or more of the
   sessions with vacant chairs (such sessions are identified by "TBA" in
   the schedule), then please email us the following information (we would
   like to have two or more chairs per session):

        I am 100% confident that I will be attending the conference AND I am
        willing to chair/moderate one or more of the sessions below:

        Session ID Number(s) and Title(s):
        Date of the session(s):
        Your Title (Prof./Dr./...):
        Your name:
        Your affiliation and country:

-> If your paper is scheduled in the program BUT NONE of the authors of
   your paper will be attending to present it, then please email us the
   following information so that we can remove your talk from the schedule
   (this would not affect the publication of your paper):

        Our paper is scheduled into the program for presentation but
        none of us (the authors) are able to attend the conference; therefore,
        please remove our talk from the schedule.

        Your paper ID number:
        Title of paper:
        Names of Authors of paper:
        Complete shipping address of the author who registered:


-> If you have registered for the conference and are absolutely sure that
   you will be attending the conference to present it BUT your paper is
   not included in the schedule, then please provide the following
   information:

        My paper should be scheduled for presentation BUT it is not in the schedule.
        Please include it in the schedule.

        Your paper ID number:
        Title of your paper:
        Your name (name of registered author):

-> We have reserved a large block of rooms at Monte Carlo Resort (the location of
   the conference) at a low negotiated rate. The hotel has agreed to extend the
   reservation deadline at the low rate till June 24, 2012. If you wish to stay
   at the hotel where the conference will be held, then you need to do your room
   reservation very soon - our block of 3,800 room nights are getting close to
   being fully booked (reservations will be honored by the hotel on First-Come
   First-Serve basis till the block is fully booked). In order to reserve a room
   at the hotel, see the web link below (for rates and reservation system):
   http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp12/ws/location

Authors whose papers have been accepted BUT were unable to register and
upload their papers to the publication web site, can still do so by June 24,
2012 (like prior years, the papers of registered authors will be published
irrespective of attendance status). In order to register (as an author or
a simple attendee), go to the following web site:
http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp12/ws/registration

Indications are that we will have a great conference.
Looking forward to seeing you in July.

Kind regards,
Steering Committee
ps. The conference schedule below is only for ICAI'12; there are many other
    tracks that are currently being prepared.

                       ICAI'12 CONFERENCE SCHEDULES

                   The 2012 International Conference on
                          Artificial Intelligence

There are a number of other sessions (not listed as part of ICAI'12 in this
schedule) that are of potential interest to ICAI'12 participants (sessions
belonging to other joint conferences of WORLDCOMP.) Therefore, you are
encouraged to also check the schedules of other joint conferences. In
particular, sessions in BIOCOMP'12, DMIN'12, EEE'12, GEM'12, IKE'12, and
IPCV'12, discuss topics that are within the scope of ICAI; these have
been scheduled so that selected ICAI'12 attendees can also participate in
them.

Note that each conference is divided into a number of topical sessions. These
sessions are not necessarily scheduled in the same room/location. Therefore,
conference attendees are to check the location of the session(s) they wish to
attend; The conference room numbers (Locations) appear in this document.
