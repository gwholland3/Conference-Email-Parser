In 2014, the federated meeting that this conference is part of had
attracted speakers/authors affiliated with over 180 different universities
(including many from the top 50 ranked institutions), many major IT
corporations (including, Microsoft, Google, SAP, Oracle, Amazon, Yahoo,

April 30, 2015:    Notification of acceptance (+/- two days)

SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading
them to the evaluation web site at:

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sam15 

Submissions must be uploaded by April 15, 2015 and must be in either
pdf format (about 7 pages including all figures, tables, and
references - single space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable
typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted
papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting format to
prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have been
previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.
The first page of the paper should include: title of the paper, name,
affiliation, postal address, and email address for each author. The
first page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a
maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the content
of the paper. The track title must also be stated on the first page of
the paper as well as a 100 to 150-word abstract. The length of the
final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to 7 (two-column
IEEE style) pages.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases of
contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference program
committee would be charged to make the final decision (accept/reject);
often, this would involve seeking help from additional referees. Papers
whose authors include a member of the conference program committee will
be evaluated using the double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical
papers will not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).

The proceedings will be published in printed conference books (ISBN) and
will also be made available online. The printed proceedings/books will
be available for distribution on site at the conference. The proceedings
will be indexed in science citation databases that track citation
frequency/data. The proceedings/books of SAM annual conferences have
been evaluated and approved for inclusion into major science citation
index databases for indexing, integrating, and inclusion into relevant
systems. The proceedings have also been approved for inclusion into
EBSCO ( www.ebsco.com ), one of the largest subject index systems. The
titles of proceedings of SAM have been indexed into the ACM Digital
Library ( http://dl.acm.org/ ) which includes bibliographic citations
from major publishers in computing.

In addition to the above, we have arranged two new book series (multiple
books in each series); one with Elsevier publishers (Emerging Trends in
Computer Science and Applied Computing) and another with Springer
publishers (Transactions of Computational Science and Computational
Intelligence). After the conference (the process may take 12 to 18
months), a significant number of authors of accepted papers of our
congress, will be given the opportunity to submit the extended version
of their papers for publication consideration in these books. We
anticipate having between 10 and 20 books a year in each of these
book series projects. Each book in each series will be subject to
Elsevier and Springer science indexing products (which includes:
Scopus, www.info.scopus.com ; SCI Compendex, Engineering Village,
www.ei.org ; EMBASE, www.info.embase.com ; and others). For a recent and
a very small subset of the books (and journal special issues) that have
been published based on the extended versions of our congress papers,
see below: 138939

SUBMISSION OF POSTER PAPERS:

Poster papers can be 2 pages long. Authors are to follow the same
instructions that appear above (see, SUBMISSION OF REGULAR PAPERS) except
for poster submission is limited to 2 pages. On the first page, the author
should state that "This paper is being submitted as a poster". Poster
papers (if accepted) will be published if and only the author of the
accepted paper wishes to do so. Please email your poster papers to the
poster co-chairs:
Hanen Idoudi ( Hanen.Idoudi@ensi.rnu.tn ), or
Esmiralda Moradian ( esmirald@dsv.su.se ).


MEASURABLE SCIENTIFIC IMPACT OF CONGRESS:

As of December 14, 2014, proceedings of the federated congress that this
conference is part of, have received over 27,914 citations (includes 3,346
self-citations). Citation data is obtained from Microsoft Academic Search.
The citation data does not even include more than 15,000 other citations
to papers published by conferences whose first offerings were initiated
by the congress. Individual proceedings/books (2013 & 2014) of the
federated congress can be purchased from major science book distributors:
