   papers for publication which conform to the two-column IEEE style
   format - see:
   https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
   The first page of the paper should include:

   - Title of the paper

     permitting).
   Submissions are to be uploaded to the submission/evaluation web site
   portal at http://american-cse.org/ 

   Each paper will be peer-reviewed by at least two experts in the field
   for originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness.
