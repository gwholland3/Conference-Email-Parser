Dear all,
The submission deadline for the TGAP Workshop is extended with a week. Th=

CALL =46OR PAPERS
Teaching Games:Pedagogical Approaches DiGRA 2019 Pre-Conference Workshop =
(TGPA:DiGRA2019)

Context of Teaching Games
Game studies, art, design, narrative, development, and game research meth=
od courses are proliferating across colleges and universities. Some class=
es are organized into formal game design programs while others are not. T=
hey can be offered in a wide range of departments and disciplines, includ=
ing media studies, communications, computer science, sociology, English, =
education, political science, art, and many others. The primary goal of s=
uch courses is varied: to teach game design skills, game writing, product=
ion, development, critical analysis skills, as well as the history and co=
ntext of digital games. This workshop is for instructors in higher educat=
ion of all such courses to discuss their approaches, troubleshoot issues,=
 as well as identify best practices for the course and assignment design.=

The workshop is co-located and organized with the 2019 DiGRA 2019 confere=
nce in Kyoto, Japan, and will take place on August 6th, 2019. It builds o=
n successful past versions of the workshop run at both DiGRA and =46DG in=
 2014 and 2015, as well as on a later workshop on transgressive teaching =
strategies in game studies at NDigra in 2018 and HEVGA Game Educators=E2=80=
=99 Summits and symposia held in 2017 and 2018. The aim of this iteration=
 is threefold: to broaden the scope of teaching about games more generall=
y, to build a community around pedagogy and to generate scholarship that =
will result in a peer-reviewed publication.

Objectives and Outcomes
The aim of the workshop is to benefit pedagogy about games by discussing =
current issues and potential future directions in games teaching as well =
as to provide a forum for sharing and critiquing pedagogical practices. T=
he latter will be especially valuable for scholars who are among the only=
 faculty at their institution teaching games.
The workshop will be conducted in two parts: The morning session will be =
dedicated to paper presentations and discussions. The post-lunch session =
will be organized as work sessions, where groups discuss particular topic=
s (self-organized by interests).

*** Topics ***
The workshop invites papers about teaching games in higher education. The=
 following list suggests topics, but other topics relevant to pedagogical=
 approaches in teaching games are welcome.
=E2=97=8F Pedagogical methods to teaching games
=E2=97=8F Integrating games into a pre-existing curriculum

Teaching Games:Pedagogical Approaches DiGRA 2019 Pre-Conference Workshop (T=
GPA:DiGRA2019)<br>
<br>
Context of Teaching Games<br>
Game studies, art, design, narrative, development, and game research method=
 courses are proliferating across colleges and universities. Some classes a=
re organized into formal game design programs while others are not. They ca=
n be offered in a wide range of departments and disciplines, including medi=
a studies, communications, computer science, sociology, English, education,=
 political science, art, and many others. The primary goal of such courses =
is varied: to teach game design skills, game writing, production, developme=
nt, critical analysis skills, as well as the history and context of digital=
 games. This workshop is for instructors in higher education of all such co=
urses to discuss their approaches, troubleshoot issues, as well as identify=
 best practices for the course and assignment design.<br>
The workshop is co-located and organized with the 2019 DiGRA 2019 conferenc=
e in Kyoto, Japan, and will take place on August 6th, 2019. It builds on su=
ccessful past versions of the workshop run at both DiGRA and FDG in 2014 an=
d 2015, as well as on a later workshop on transgressive teaching strategies=
 in game studies at NDigra in 2018 and HEVGA Game Educators=E2=80=99 Summit=
s and symposia held in 2017 and 2018. The aim of this iteration is threefol=
d: to broaden the scope of teaching about games more generally, to build a =
community around pedagogy and to generate scholarship that will result in a=
 peer-reviewed publication.<br>
<br>
Objectives and Outcomes<br>
The aim of the workshop is to benefit pedagogy about games by discussing cu=
rrent issues and potential future directions in games teaching as well as t=
o provide a forum for sharing and critiquing pedagogical practices. The lat=
ter will be especially valuable for scholars who are among the only faculty=
 at their institution teaching games.<br>
The workshop will be conducted in two parts: The morning session will be de=
dicated to paper presentations and discussions. The post-lunch session will=
 be organized as work sessions, where groups discuss particular topics (sel=
f-organized by interests).<br>
<br>
*** Topics ***<br>
The workshop invites papers about teaching games in higher education. The f=
ollowing list suggests topics, but other topics relevant to pedagogical app=
roaches in teaching games are welcome.<br>
