s minds. I have been discussing this issue with Alina Latypova, the conferen=
ce chair. My understanding is that St Petersburg is an international city, a=
nd that it is extremely unlikely that there will be any LGBT directed harass=
ment. There also appear to be high levels of support for equal rights for th=
e LGBT community in response to the government=E2=80=99s lamentable position=
. Of course nobody can give definitive assurances about any city, but I hope=
 that we can offer some reassurances. We have an inclusivity policy that is s=

 of Computer Games=E2=80=99. Playing games yields particular kinds of playfu=

 not limited to) the following themes and questions:=20
>>>>>=20
>>>>> 1. Aesthetics as aesthesis (a=C3=ADsth=C4=93sis). Is there an aestheti=
cs or mode of experience that is specific to computer games? How do their vi=
sual, audio, and haptic aspects come together to produce distinctive experie=
nces? How are =E2=80=98experience=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98perception=E2=80=99 e=

e productively applied to computer games? What is the role of game interface=
s on player experience?=20
>>>>>=20
>>>>> 2. Games as art? What are the conditions of possibility of games being=
 art? How do computer games fit into established categories or conventions o=
f aesthetics, and how do they contribute to new ones? Do games recognised as=
 having a claim to artistic status differ from mainstream games? How do acco=
unts of art based on necessary and sufficient conditions match up against an=
ti-essentialist accounts in terms of gauging the status of computer games?=20=

>>>>>=20
>>>>> 3. The aesthetics of gaming practices. Are games collaboratively autho=
red? How do different kinds of play, or player-game conjunctions, bring abou=
t different kinds of gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences? How do diffe=
rent bodies encounter computer games and what can be said about the way in w=
hich gameplay experience is mediated by our bodies?=20
>>>>> Do some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic player practices have an aest=
hetic orientation? Are computer games performances?=20
>>>>>=20
>>>>> 4. The ethical, political, and social dimensions of game aesthetics. W=
hat is the transformative potential of computer games and how does this comp=
are to the transformative capabilities ascribed to artworks? How do aestheti=
c issues interconnect with ethical, social, and political ones =E2=80=93 wha=
t is the autonomy or heteronomy of the aesthetic domain? How are taste, sens=
ibility, and habit acquired with respect to gameplay and what are the social=
 implications of this?=20
>>>>>=20
>>>>> In addition to this central theme, the conference also features an ope=
n category, for which we invite welcome contributions that do not fit this y=
ear=E2=80=99s theme, but that nonetheless offer a valuable contribution to t=
he philosophy of computer games.=20
>>>>>=20
>>>>> Submitted proposals should have a clear focus on philosophy and philos=
ophical (including media philosophical) issues in relation to computer games=
. They should also refer to specific games rather than invoke them in more g=
eneral terms. Submissions should be made in the form of extended abstracts o=

our paper to fit in the open category. The deadline for submissions is 23:59=

 prohibits spreading

            absolutely
            disgusting, from the practical point of view this law poses
            no problem for the
            foreigners coming for an international conference. The only
            way someone could
            run into problems is if there would be a person under age of
            18 present on the
            conference, and then someone would file a complaint about
            him hearing something
            positive about LGBT. But since conference would be in
            English, and most Russians,
            especially those who support this law, do not know this

                <p>Dear Dr Parker,</p>
                <p>Thanks for asking a question that may have been on
                  many people=E2=80=99s minds. I have been discussing this =
issue
                  with Alina Latypova, the conference chair. My
                  understanding is that St Petersburg is an
                  international city, and that it is extremely unlikely
                  that there will be any LGBT directed harassment. There
                  also appear to be high levels of support for equal
                  rights for the LGBT community in response to the
                  government=E2=80=99s lamentable position. Of course nobod=
y can
                  give definitive assurances about any city, but I hope
                  that we can offer some reassurances. We have an
                  inclusivity policy that is stated on the website.
                  Anyone is welcome to write to us to continue this

                            that is specific to computer games? How do
                            their visual, audio, and haptic aspects come
                            together to produce distinctive experiences?

                            established categories or conventions of
                            aesthetics, and how do they contribute to

                            mainstream games? How do accounts of art
                            based on necessary and sufficient conditions
                            match up against anti-essentialist accounts

                            Are games collaboratively authored? How do

                            conjunctions, bring about different kinds of
                            gaming pleasures or aesthetic experiences?
                            How do different bodies encounter computer
                            games and what can be said about the way in

                            bodies? <br>
                            Do some kinds of gameplay or extra-gamic
                            player practices have an aesthetic
                            orientation? Are computer games
                            performances? <br>

                            the transformative potential of computer
