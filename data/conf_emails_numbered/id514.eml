There is no such thing as personal security in an authoritarian state. And
we live with it, and look, we are actually trying to do something in spite
of that (I am not LGBT, but I have my own reasons to be insecure).
I've just realized that I was going to submit a talk on a very, very
queer/trans game. It is just a coincidence, and I have been sketching that
proposal for a year, I suppose (queerness was not the main point anyway),
so I hope it will be good enough. See you in Saint Petersburg - let's do
some gay propaganda. Who's with me?

 prohibits spreading

            absolutely
            disgusting, from the practical point of view this law poses
            no problem for the
            foreigners coming for an international conference. The only
            way someone could
            run into problems is if there would be a person under age of
            18 present on the

            him hearing something
            positive about LGBT. But since conference would be in
            English, and most Russians,
            especially those who support this law, do not know this

                <p>Dear Dr Parker,</p>
                <p>Thanks for asking a question that may have been on
                  many people=E2=80=99s minds. I have been discussing this =
issue
                  with Alina Latypova, the conference chair. My
                  understanding is that St Petersburg is an
                  international city, and that it is extremely unlikely
                  that there will be any LGBT directed harassment. There
                  also appear to be high levels of support for equal
                  rights for the LGBT community in response to the
                  government=E2=80=99s lamentable position. Of course nobod=
y can
                  give definitive assurances about any city, but I hope
                  that we can offer some reassurances. We have an
                  inclusivity policy that is stated on the website.
                  Anyone is welcome to write to us to continue this

                            games and what can be said about the way in
